You can send over-the-air updates containing critical bug fixes and improvements to your users.

## Get started

> If you've published [previews](/review/share-previews-with-your-team) or created a [build](/deploy/build-project) before, you may have already set up updates and can skip this section.

To set up updates, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools#eas-cli) command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas update:configure`

After the command completes, you'll need to make new builds before continuing to the next section.

## Send an update

To send an update, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools#eas-cli) command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas update --channel production`

This command will create an update and make it available to builds of your app that are configured to receive updates on the `production` channel. This channel is defined in [eas.json](/eas/json#channel).

You can verify the update works by force closing the app and reopening it two times. The update should be applied on the second launch.

## Send updates automatically

You can automatically send updates with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/introduction). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started), add a file named .eas/workflows/send-updates.yml at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

.eas/workflows/send-updates.yml

Copy


    name: Send updates

    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main']

    jobs:
      send_updates:
        name: Send updates
        type: update
        params:
          channel: production


The workflow above will send an over-the-air update for the `production` update channel on every commit to your project's `main` branch. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas workflow:run send-updates.yml`

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples/introduction).
