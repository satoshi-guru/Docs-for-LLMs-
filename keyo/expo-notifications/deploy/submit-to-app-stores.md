## Apple App Store

Prerequisites

4 requirements

1.

Sign up for an Apple Developer account

An Apple Developer account is required to submit your app to the Apple App Store. You can sign up for an Apple Developer account on the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

2.

Include a bundle identifier in app.json

Include your app's bundle identifier in app.json:

app.json

Copy


    {
      "ios": {
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
      }
    }


3.

Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account

Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npm install -g eas-cli && eas login`

4.

Build a production app

You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction):

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas build --platform ios --profile production`

Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform ios --profile production --local` or with Xcode.

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can start the submission process.

Run the following command to submit a build to the Apple App Store:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas submit --platform ios`

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app.

## Google Play Store

Prerequisites

7 requirements

1.

Sign up for a Google Play Developer account

A Google Play Developer account is required to submit your app to the Google Play Store. You can sign up for a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).

2.

Create a Google Service Account

EAS requires you to upload and configure a Google Service Account Key to submit your Android app to the Google Play Store. You can create one with the [uploading a Google Service Account Key for Play Store submissions with EAS](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md) guide.

3.

Create an app on Google Play Console

Create an app by clicking Create app in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).

4.

Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account

Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npm install -g eas-cli && eas login`

5.

Include a package name in app.json

Include your app's package name in app.json:

app.json

Copy


    {
      "android": {
        "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
      }
    }


6.

Build a production app

You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction):

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas build --platform android --profile production`

Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform android --profile production --local` or with Android Studio.

7.

Upload your app manually at least once

You have to upload your app manually at least once. This is a limitation of the Google Play Store API.

Learn how with the [first submission of an Android app](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) guide.

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can start the submission process.

Run the following command to submit a build to the Google Play Store:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas submit --platform android`

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app.

## Build and submit automatically

You can automatically create builds and submit them to the app stores with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/introduction). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started), add a file named .eas/workflows/build-and-submit.yml at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

.eas/workflows/build-and-submit.yml

Copy


    name: Build and submit

    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main']

    jobs:
      build_android:
        name: Build Android app
        type: build
        params:
          platform: android
          profile: production
      build_ios:
        name: Build iOS app
        type: build
        params:
          platform: ios
          profile: production
      submit_android:
        name: Submit Android
        type: submit
        needs: [build_android]
        params:
          build_id: ${{ needs.build_android.outputs.build_id }}
      submit_ios:
        name: Submit iOS
        type: submit
        needs: [build_ios]
        params:
          build_id: ${{ needs.build_ios.outputs.build_id }}


The workflow above will create Android and iOS builds on every commit to your project's `main` branch, then submit them to the Google Play and Apple App Store respectively. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas workflow:run build-and-submit.yml`

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples/introduction).
