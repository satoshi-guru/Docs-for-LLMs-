If you are building a universal app, you can quickly deploy your web app using [EAS Hosting](/eas/hosting/introduction). It is a service for deploying web apps built with Expo Router and React.

Prerequisites

1 requirement

Set `expo.web.output` in app.json

In your project's app.json, ensure that the [`expo.web.output`](/versions/latest/config/app#output) property is either `static` or `server`.

## Export your web project

To deploy your web app, you need to create a static build of your web project. Export your web project into a dist directory by running the following command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo export --platform web`

> Remember to re-run this command every time before deploying when you make changes to your web app.

## Initial deployment

To publish your web app, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools#eas-cli) command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas deploy`

After running this command for the first time, you'll be prompted to select a preview subdomain for your project. This subdomain is a prefix used to create a preview URL and is used for production deployments. For example, in `https://test-app--1234.expo.app`, `test-app` is the preview subdomain.

Once your deployment is complete, the EAS CLI will output a preview URL to access your deployed app.

## Production deployment

To create a production deployment, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools#eas-cli) command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas deploy --prod`

Once your deployment is complete, the EAS CLI will output a production URL to access your deployed app.

## Deploy automatically

You can automatically deploy your app to the web with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/introduction). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started), add a file named .eas/workflows/deploy-web.yml at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

.eas/workflows/deploy-web.yml

Copy


    name: Deploy web

    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main']

    jobs:
      deploy_web:
        name: Deploy web
        type: deploy
        params:
          prod: true


The workflow above will create a web deployment on every commit to your project's `main` branch. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas workflow:run deploy-web.yml`

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples/introduction).
