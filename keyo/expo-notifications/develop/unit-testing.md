[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is the most widely used unit and snapshot JavaScript testing framework. In this guide, you will learn how to set up Jest in your project, write a unit test, write a snapshot test, and best practices for structuring your tests when using Jest with React Native.

You will also use the [`jest-expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/jest-expo) library, which is a Jest preset that mocks the native part of the Expo SDK and handles most of the configuration required for your Expo project.

## Installation and configuration

After creating your Expo project, follow the instructions below to install and configure `jest-expo` in your project:

1

Install `jest-expo` and other required dev dependencies in your project. Run the following command from your project's root directory:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install jest-expo jest @types/jest --dev`

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install jest-expo jest @types/jest "--" --dev`

> Note: If your project is not using TypeScript, you can skip installing `@types/jest`.

If your project uses TypeScript, add `"jest"` to the `types` array in your tsconfig.json to enable Jest's type definitions:

tsconfig.json

Copy


    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["jest"]
      }
    }


2

Open package.json, add a script for running tests, and add the preset for using the base configuration from `jest-expo`:

package.json

Copy


    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "jest --watchAll"
        %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%},
      "jest": {
        "preset": "jest-expo"
      }
    }


3

In package.json, add `jest-expo` as a preset so that a base for Jest's configuration is set up:

package.json

Copy


    {
      "jest": {
        "preset": "jest-expo"
      }
    }


Additional configuration for using `transformIgnorePatterns`

You can transpile node modules your project uses by configuring [`transformIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring) in your package.json. This property takes a regex pattern as its value:

npm/Yarn

pnpm

package.json

Copy


    "jest": {
      "preset": "jest-expo",
      "transformIgnorePatterns": [
        "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@sentry/react-native|native-base|react-native-svg)"
      ]
    }


package.json

Copy


    "jest": {
      "preset": "jest-expo",
      "transformIgnorePatterns": [
        "node_modules/(?!(?:.pnpm/)?((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@sentry/react-native|native-base|react-native-svg))"
      ]
    }


Jest has many configuration options, but the above configuration should cover most of your needs. However, you can always add to this pattern list. For more details, see [Configuring Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration).

## Install React Native Testing Library

The [React Native Testing Library (`@testing-library/react-native`)](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) is a lightweight solution for testing React Native components. It provides utility functions and works with Jest.

To install it, run the following command:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install @testing-library/react-native --dev`

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install @testing-library/react-native "--" --dev`

> [Deprecated](/more/release-statuses#deprecated): `@testing-library/react-native` replaces the deprecated `react-test-renderer` because `react-test-renderer` does not support React 19 and above. Remove the deprecated library from your project if you are currently using it. See [React's documentation for more information](https://react.dev/warnings/react-test-renderer).

## Unit test

A unit test checks the smallest unit of code, usually a function. To write your first unit test, take a look at the following example:

1

Inside the src/app directory of your project, create a new file called index.tsx, and the following code to render a simple component:

index.tsx

Copy


    import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
    import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

    export const CustomText = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren) => <Text>{children}</Text>;

    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <CustomText>Welcome!</CustomText>
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    });


2

Create a __tests__ directory at the root of your project's directory. If this directory already exists in your project, use that. Then, create a new file called home-screen-test.tsx. The `jest-expo` preset customizes the Jest configuration to also identify files with -test.ts|tsx extensions as tests.

Add the following example code in home-screen-test.tsx:

home-screen-test.tsx

Copy


    import { render } from '@testing-library/react-native';

    import HomeScreen, { CustomText } from '@/app/index';

    describe('<HomeScreen />', () => {
      test('Text renders correctly on HomeScreen', () => {
        const { getByText } = render(<HomeScreen />);

        getByText('Welcome!');
      });
    });


In the above example, the `getByText` query helps your tests find relevant element in your app's user interface and make assertion whether or not the certain element exists. The React Native Testing Library provides this query, and each [query variant](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api/queries#query-variant) differs in its return type. For more examples and detailed API information, see the React Native Testing Library's [Queries API reference](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api/queries).

3

Run the following command in a terminal window to execute the test:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npm run test`

You will see one test being passed.

## Structure your tests

Organizing your test files is important to make them easier to maintain. A common pattern is creating a __tests__ directory and putting all your tests inside.

An example structure of tests next to the components directory is shown below:

`__tests__`

`themed-text-test.tsx`

`src`

`components`

`themed-text.tsx`

`themed-view.tsx`

Alternatively, you can have multiple __tests__ sub-directories for different areas of your project. For example, create a separate test directory for components, and so on:

`src`

`components`

`themed-text.tsx`

`__tests__`

`themed-text-test.tsx`

`utils`

`index.tsx`

`__tests__`

`index-test.tsx`

It's all about preferences, and it is up to you to decide how you want to organize your project directory.

## Snapshot test

> Note: For UI testing, we recommend end-to-end tests instead of snapshot unit tests. See the [E2E tests with Maestro](/eas/workflows/examples/e2e-tests) guide.

A [snapshot test](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) is used to make sure that UI stays consistent, especially when a project is working with global styles that are potentially shared across components.

To add a snapshot test for `<HomeScreen />`, add the following code snippet in the `describe()` in home-screen-test.tsx:

home-screen-test.tsx

Copy


    describe('<HomeScreen />', () => {
      %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%

      test('CustomText renders correctly', () => {
        const tree = render(<CustomText>Some text</CustomText>).toJSON();

        expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
      });
    });


Run `npm run test` command, and you will see a snapshot created inside __tests__\\__snapshots__ directory, and two tests passed.

## Code coverage reports

Code coverage reports can help you understand how much of your code is tested. To see the code coverage report in your project using the HTML format, in package.json, under `jest`, set the `collectCoverage` to true and use `collectCoverageFrom` to specify a list of files to ignore when collecting the coverage.

package.json

Copy


    "jest": {
      ...
      "collectCoverage": true,
      "collectCoverageFrom": [
        "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",
        "!**/coverage/**",
        "!**/node_modules/**",
        "!**/babel.config.js",
        "!**/expo-env.d.ts",
        "!**/.expo/**"
      ]
    }


Run `npm run test`. You will see a coverage directory created in your project. Find the lcov-report/index.html and open it in a browser to see the coverage report.

> Usually, we don't recommend uploading index.html file to git. Add `coverage/**/*` in the .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked.

## Jest flows (optional)

You can also use different flows to run your tests. Below are a few example scripts that you can try:

package.json

Copy


    "scripts": {
      "test": "jest --watch --coverage=false --changedSince=origin/main",
      "testDebug": "jest -o --watch --coverage=false",
      "testFinal": "jest",
      "updateSnapshots": "jest -u --coverage=false"
      %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%
    }
