## Properties

### `name`

Type: `string`

The name of your app as it appears both within Expo Go and on your home screen as a standalone app.

Existing React Native app?

To change the name of your app, edit the 'Display Name' field in Xcode and the `app_name` string in `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

The auto generated Expo account name and slug used for services like Notifications and AuthSession proxy. It is not meant to be set directly. Formatted like `@username/slug`. When unauthenticated, the username is `@anonymous`. For published projects, this value will not change when a project is transferred between accounts or renamed.

### `sdkVersion`

Type: `string`

The Expo sdkVersion to run the project on. This should line up with the version specified in your package.json.

### `runtimeVersion`

One of types:

  * `string` matching the following pattern: `^[a-zA-Z\d][a-zA-Z\d._+()-]{0,254}$`
  * `string` matching the following pattern: `^exposdk:((\d+\.\d+\.\d+)|(UNVERSIONED))$`
  * An `object` with the following properties:

Valid values: `nativeVersion`, `sdkVersion`, `appVersion`, `fingerprint`.


Property indicating compatibility between a build's native code and an OTA update.

### `version`

Type: `string`

Your app version. In addition to this field, you'll also use `ios.buildNumber` and `android.versionCode` — read more about how to version your app [here](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/app-stores/#versioning-your-app). On iOS this corresponds to `CFBundleShortVersionString`, and on Android, this corresponds to `versionName`. The required format can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleshortversionstring).

Existing React Native app?

To change your app version, edit the 'Version' field in Xcode and the `versionName` string in `android/app/build.gradle`

### `platforms`

Type: `array`

Platforms that your project explicitly supports. If not specified, it defaults to `["ios", "android"]`. If `react-dom` is installed, `web` is also included by default.

Example

`[ "ios", "android", "web" ]`

### `githubUrl`

Type: `string`

If you would like to share the source code of your app on Github, enter the URL for the repository here and it will be linked to from your Expo project page.

Example

`"https://github.com/expo/expo"`

### `orientation`

Type: `enum` • One of: `default`, `portrait`, `landscape`

Locks your app to a specific orientation with portrait or landscape. Defaults to no lock. Valid values: `default`, `portrait`, `landscape`

### `userInterfaceStyle`

Type: `enum` • One of: `light`, `dark`, `automatic`

Configuration to force the app to always use the light or dark user-interface appearance, such as "dark mode", or make it automatically adapt to the system preferences. If not provided, defaults to `light`. Requires `expo-system-ui` be installed in your project to work on Android.

### `backgroundColor`

Type: `string`

The background color for your app, behind any of your React views. This is also known as the root view background color. Requires `expo-system-ui` be installed in your project to work on iOS.

6 character long hex color string, for example, `'#000000'`. Default is white: `'#ffffff'`

### `primaryColor`

Type: `string`

On Android, this will determine the color of your app in the multitasker. Currently this is not used on iOS, but it may be used for other purposes in the future.

6 character long hex color string, for example, `'#000000'`

### `icon`

Type: `string`

Local path or remote URL to an image to use for your app's icon. We recommend that you use a 1024x1024 png file. This icon will appear on the home screen and within the Expo Go app.

Existing React Native app?

To change your app's icon, edit or replace the files in `ios/<PROJECT-NAME>/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` (we recommend using Xcode), and `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-<RESOLUTION>`. Be sure to follow the guidelines for each platform ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/), [Android 7.1 and below](https://material.io/design/iconography/#icon-treatments), and [Android 8+](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive)) and to provide your new icon in each existing size.

### `androidStatusBar`

Type: `object`

Configuration for the status bar on Android. For more details navigate to [Configuring StatusBar](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/configuring-statusbar/). @deprecated Use the `expo-status-bar` plugin configuration instead

#### `barStyle`

Type: `enum` • One of: `light-content`, `dark-content` • Path: `androidStatusBar.barStyle`

Configures the status bar icons to have a light or dark color. Valid values: `light-content`, `dark-content`. Defaults to `dark-content`

#### `backgroundColor`

Type: `string` • Path: `androidStatusBar.backgroundColor`

Specifies the background color of the status bar. Defaults to `#00000000` (transparent) for `dark-content` bar style and `#00000088` (semi-transparent black) for `light-content` bar style

6 character long hex color string `'#RRGGBB'`, for example, `'#000000'` for black. Or 8 character long hex color string `'#RRGGBBAA'`, for example, `'#00000088'` for semi-transparent black.

#### `hidden`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `androidStatusBar.hidden`

Instructs the system whether the status bar should be visible or not. Defaults to `false`

#### `translucent`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `androidStatusBar.translucent`

When false, the system status bar pushes the content of your app down (similar to `position: relative`). When true, the status bar floats above the content in your app (similar to `position: absolute`). Defaults to `true` to match the iOS status bar behavior (which can only float above content). Explicitly setting this property to `true` will add `android:windowTranslucentStatus` to `styles.xml` and may cause unexpected keyboard behavior on Android when using the `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` set to `resize`. In this case you will have to use `KeyboardAvoidingView` to manage the keyboard layout.

### `developmentClient`

Type: `object`

Settings that apply specifically to running this app in a development client

#### `silentLaunch`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `developmentClient.silentLaunch`

If true, the app will launch in a development client with no additional dialogs or progress indicators, just like in a standalone app.

### `scheme`

  * `string` matching the following pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*$`
`{ "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*$" } }`


URL scheme(s) to link into your app. For example, if we set this to `'demo'`, then demo:// URLs would open your app when tapped. This is a build-time configuration, it has no effect in Expo Go.

String beginning with a lowercase letter followed by any combination of lowercase letters, digits, "+", "." or "-"

Existing React Native app?

To change your app's scheme, replace all occurrences of the old scheme in `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`

### `extra`

Set this to `NEVER` to disable automatic checking. Valid values: `ON_LOAD` (default value), `ON_ERROR_RECOVERY`, `WIFI_ONLY`, `NEVER`

#### `useEmbeddedUpdate`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `updates.useEmbeddedUpdate`

Whether to load the embedded update. Defaults to true. If set to false, an update will be fetched at launch. When set to false, ensure that `checkAutomatically` is set to `ON_LOAD` and `fallbackToCacheTimeout` is large enough for the initial remote update to download. This should not be used in production.

#### `fallbackToCacheTimeout`

Example: Given a value of `['app/images/**/*.png', 'app/fonts/**/*.woff']` all `.png` files in all subdirectories of `app/images` and all `.woff` files in all subdirectories of `app/fonts` will be included in updates.

#### `disableAntiBrickingMeasures`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `updates.disableAntiBrickingMeasures`

Whether to disable the built-in expo-updates anti-bricking measures. Defaults to false. If set to true, this will allow overriding certain configuration options from the JS API, which is liable to leave an app in a bricked state if not done carefully. This should not be used in production.

#### `useNativeDebug`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `updates.useNativeDebug`

Enable debugging of native code with updates enabled. Defaults to false. If set to true, the EX_UPDATES_NATIVE_DEBUG environment variable will be set in Podfile.properties.json and gradle.properties.
