package.json is a JSON file that contains the metadata for a JavaScript project. This is a reference to Expo-specific properties that can be used by adding an `expo` field in the package.json file.

## `install.exclude`

The following commands perform a version check for the libraries installed in a project and give a warning when a library's version is different from the version recommended by Expo:

  * `npx expo start` and `npx expo-doctor`
  * `npx expo install` (when installing a new version of that library or using `--check` or `--fix` options)


By adding the library under the `install.exclude` array in the package.json file, you can exclude it from the version checks:

package.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "install": {
          "exclude": ["expo-updates", "expo-splash-screen"]
        }
      }
    }


## `autolinking`

Allows configuring module resolution behavior by using `autolinking` property in package.json.

package.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "autolinking": {
          "nativeModulesDir": "./modules"
        }
      }
    }


For complete reference, see [Autolinking configuration](/modules/autolinking#configuration).

## `doctor`

Allows configuring the behavior of the [`npx expo-doctor`](/develop/tools#expo-doctor) command.

### `reactNativeDirectoryCheck`

By default, Expo Doctor validates your project's packages against the [React Native directory](https://reactnative.directory/). This check throws a warning with a list of packages that are not included in the React Native Directory.

You can customize this check by adding the following configuration in your project's package.json file:

package.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "doctor": {
          "reactNativeDirectoryCheck": {
            "enabled": true,
            "exclude": ["/foo/", "bar"],
            "listUnknownPackages": true
          }
        }
      }
    }


By default, the check is enabled and unknown packages are listed.

### `appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck`

Expo Doctor checks if your project includes native project directories such as android or ios. If these directories exist but are not listed in your .gitignore or [.easignore](/build-reference/easignore) files, Expo Doctor verifies the presence of an app config file. If this file exists, it means your project is configured to use [Prebuild](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild).

When the android or ios directories are present, EAS Build does not sync app config properties to the native projects. Expo Doctor throws a warning if these conditions are true.

You can disable or enable this check by adding the following configuration to your project's package.json file:

package.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "doctor": {
          "appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck": {
            "enabled": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
