    });


## API


    import * as Battery from 'expo-battery';


## Hooks

### `useBatteryLevel()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the device's battery level, as in `getBatteryLevelAsync`.

Returns:

`number`

The battery level of the device.

Example


    const batteryLevel = useBatteryLevel();


### `useBatteryState()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the device's battery state, as in `getBatteryStateAsync`.

Returns:

`BatteryState`

The battery state of the device.

Example


    const batteryState = useBatteryState();


### `useLowPowerMode()`

Android

iOS

Web

Boolean that indicates if the device is in low power or power saver mode, as in `isLowPowerModeEnabledAsync`.

Returns:

`boolean`

Returns a boolean indicating if the device is in low power mode.

Example


    const lowPowerMode = useLowPowerMode();


### `usePowerState()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the device's power state information, as in `getPowerStateAsync`.

Returns:

`PowerState`

Returns power state information.

Example


    const { lowPowerMode, batteryLevel, batteryState } = usePowerState();


## Methods

### `getBatteryLevelAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the battery level of the device as a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive. If the device does not support retrieving the battery level, this method returns `-1`. On web, this method always returns `1`.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a number between `0` and `1` representing the battery level, or `-1` if the device does not provide it.

Example


    await Battery.getBatteryLevelAsync();
    // 0.759999


### `getBatteryStateAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Tells the battery's current state. On web, this always returns `BatteryState.UNKNOWN`.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<BatteryState>`

Returns a `Promise` which fulfills with a `Battery.BatteryState` enum value for whether the device is any of the five states.

Example


    await Battery.getBatteryStateAsync();
    // BatteryState.CHARGING


### `getPowerStateAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the power state of the device including the battery level, whether it is plugged in, and if the system is currently operating in Power Saver Mode (Android) or Low Power Mode (iOS). This method re-throws any errors that occur when retrieving any of the power-state information.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PowerState>`

Returns a `Promise` which fulfills with `PowerState` object.

Example


    await Battery.getPowerStateAsync();
    // {
    //   batteryLevel: 0.759999,
    //   batteryState: BatteryState.UNPLUGGED,
    //   lowPowerMode: true,
    // }


### `isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Resolves with whether the battery API is available on the current device. The value of this property is `true` on Android and physical iOS devices and `false` on iOS simulators. On web, it depends on whether the browser supports the web battery API.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

### `isBatteryOptimizationEnabledAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks whether battery optimization is enabled for your application. If battery optimization is enabled for your app, background tasks might be affected when your app goes into doze mode state. (only on Android 6.0 or later)

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Returns a `Promise` which fulfills with a `boolean` value of either `true` or `false`, indicating whether the battery optimization is enabled or disabled, respectively. (Android only)

Example


    await Battery.isBatteryOptimizationEnabledAsync();
    // true


### `isLowPowerModeEnabledAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the current status of Power Saver mode on Android and Low Power mode on iOS. If a platform doesn't support Low Power mode reporting (like web, older Android devices), the reported low-power state is always `false`, even if the device is actually in low-power mode.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Returns a `Promise` which fulfills with a `boolean` value of either `true` or `false`, indicating whether low power mode is enabled or disabled.

Example

Power Saver Mode (Android) or Low Power Mode (iOS) are enabled.


    await Battery.isLowPowerModeEnabledAsync();
    // true


## Event Subscriptions

### `addBatteryLevelListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `(event: BatteryLevelEvent) => void`| A callback that is invoked when battery level changes. The callback is provided a single argument that is an object with a `batteryLevel` key.




Subscribe to the battery level change updates.

On Android devices, the event fires only when significant changes happens, which is when the battery level drops below [`android.intent.action.BATTERY_LOW`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_BATTERY_LOW) or rises above [`android.intent.action.BATTERY_OKAY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_BATTERY_OKAY) from a low battery level. See [Monitor the Battery Level and Charging State](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring) in Android documentation for more information.

On iOS devices, the event fires when the battery level drops one percent or more, but is only fired once per minute at maximum.

On web, the event never fires.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object on which you can call `remove()` to unsubscribe from the listener.

### `addBatteryStateListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `(event: BatteryStateEvent) => void`| A callback that is invoked when battery state changes. The callback is provided a single argument that is an object with a `batteryState` key.




Subscribe to the battery state change updates to receive an object with a `Battery.BatteryState` enum value for whether the device is any of the five states.

On web, the event never fires.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object on which you can call `remove()` to unsubscribe from the listener.

### `addLowPowerModeListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---

## Enums

### `BatteryState`

Android

iOS

Web

#### `UNKNOWN`

`BatteryState.UNKNOWN ＝ 0`

If the battery state is unknown or inaccessible.

#### `UNPLUGGED`

`BatteryState.UNPLUGGED ＝ 1`

If the battery is discharging (typically not connected to power). On Android, this corresponds to [`BATTERY_STATUS_DISCHARGING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#BATTERY_STATUS_DISCHARGING).

#### `CHARGING`

`BatteryState.CHARGING ＝ 2`

If battery is charging.

#### `FULL`

`BatteryState.FULL ＝ 3`

If the battery level is full.

#### `NOT_CHARGING`

Android

`BatteryState.NOT_CHARGING ＝ 4`

The battery is not charging while power is connected (AC/USB/wireless), for example when battery protection limits charge to 80%, or optimized charging pauses. This differs from `UNPLUGGED` (discharging on battery). On iOS and web, this value is never returned.
