An API to get and set screen brightness.

On Android, there is a global system-wide brightness setting, and each app has its own brightness setting that can optionally override the global setting. It is possible to set either of these values with this API. On iOS, the system brightness setting cannot be changed programmatically; instead, any changes to the screen brightness will persist until the device is locked or powered off.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-brightness`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native android project manually, then you need to add the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` permission to the AndroidManifest.xml file:

android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Copy


    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />


## Usage

Basic Brightness Usage

Copy

Open in Snack


    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
    import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

    export default function App() {
      useEffect(() => {
        (async () => {
          const { status } = await Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync();
          if (status === 'granted') {
            Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(1);
          }
        })();
      }, []);

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text>Brightness Module Example</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    });


## API


    import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';


## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions to modify the system brightness. This uses both `requestPermissionAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = Brightness.usePermissions();


## Methods

### `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()`

Android

iOS

Gets the current brightness level of the device's main screen.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Checks user's permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type PermissionResponse.

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Android

Gets the global system screen brightness.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`

A `Promise` that is resolved with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current system screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessModeAsync()`

Android

Gets the system brightness mode (e.g. whether or not the OS will automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on ambient light).

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<BrightnessMode>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a `BrightnessMode`. Requires `SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

### `Brightness.isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

Returns whether the Brightness API is enabled on the current device. This does not check the app permissions.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Async `boolean`, indicating whether the Brightness API is available on the current device. Currently this resolves `true` on iOS and Android only.

### `Brightness.isUsingSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Android

Returns a boolean specifying whether or not the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with `true` when the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value, and `false` otherwise.

### `Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type PermissionResponse.

### `Brightness.restoreSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Android

Resets the brightness setting of the current activity to use the system-wide brightness value rather than overriding it.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the setting has been successfully changed.

### `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
brightnessValue| `number`| A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness.




Sets the current screen brightness. On iOS, this setting will persist until the device is locked, after which the screen brightness will revert to the user's default setting. On Android, this setting only applies to the current activity; it will override the system brightness value whenever your app is in the foreground.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

### `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

Experimental

•

Android

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
brightnessValue| `number`| A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness.




Sets the global system screen brightness and changes the brightness mode to `MANUAL`. Requires `SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

Subscribe to brightness (iOS) updates. The event fires whenever the power mode is toggled.

On web and android the event never fires.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object on which you can call `remove()` to unsubscribe from the listener.
