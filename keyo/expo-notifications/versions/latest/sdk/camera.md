`expo-camera` provides a React component that renders a preview of the device's front or back camera. The camera's parameters such as zoom, torch, and flash mode are adjustable. Using `CameraView`, you can take photos and record videos that are saved to the app's cache. The component is also capable of detecting bar codes appearing in the preview. Run the [example](/versions/latest/sdk/camera#usage) on your device to see all these features working together.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-camera`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-camera` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-camera",
            {
              "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
              "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone",
              "recordAudioAndroid": true,
              "barcodeScannerEnabled": true
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`cameraPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera"`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission message.
`microphonePermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message.
`recordAudioAndroid`| `true`| Only for: Android
A boolean that determines whether to enable the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android.
`barcodeScannerEnabled`| `true`| A boolean that determines whether to enable barcode scanning support. Disabling this reduces app size when barcode scanning is not needed.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native android and ios projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

Android

  * `expo-camera` automatically adds `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to your project's android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml. If you want to record videos with audio, include `RECORD_AUDIO` permission:

        <!-- Added permission -->
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

        <!-- Only add when recording videos with audio -->
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />


  * Then, adjust the android/build.gradle file to add new maven block after all other repositories as show below:

        allprojects {
          repositories {
              // * Your other repositories here *
              // * Add a new maven block after other repositories / blocks *
              maven {
                  // expo-camera bundles a custom com.google.android:cameraview
                  url "$rootDir/../node_modules/expo-camera/android/maven"
              }
          }
        }



iOS

  * Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to your project's ios/[app]/Info.plist:

        <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera</string>
        <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone</string>



## Usage

> Only one Camera preview can be active at any given time. If you have multiple screens in your app, you should unmount `Camera` components whenever a screen is unfocused.

      },
      message: {
        textAlign: 'center',
        paddingBottom: 10,
      },
      camera: {
        flex: 1,

    });


### Advanced usage

[Camera app exampleA complete example that shows how to take a picture and display it. Written in TypeScript.](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-camera)

## Web support

Most browsers support a version of web camera functionality, you can check out the [web camera browser support here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream). Image URIs are always returned as base64 strings because local file system paths are unavailable in the browser.

### Chrome `iframe` usage

When using Chrome versions 64+, if you try to use a web camera in a cross-origin iframe nothing will render. To add support for cameras in your iframe simply add the attribute `allow="microphone; camera;"` to the iframe element:


    <iframe src="..." allow="microphone; camera;">
      <!-- <CameraView /> -->
    </iframe>

> Note: Avoid calling this method while the preview is paused. On Android, this will throw an error. On iOS, this will take a picture of the last frame that is currently on screen.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<CameraCapturedPicture>`

Returns a Promise that resolves to `CameraCapturedPicture` object, where `uri` is a URI to the local image file on Android, iOS, and a base64 string on web (usable as the source for an `Image` element). The `width` and `height` properties specify the dimensions of the image.

`base64` is included if the `base64` option was truthy, and is a string containing the JPEG data of the image in Base64. Prepend it with `'data:image/jpg;base64,'` to get a data URI, which you can use as the source for an `Image` element for example.

`exif` is included if the `exif` option was truthy, and is an object containing EXIF data for the image. The names of its properties are EXIF tags and their values are the values for those tags.

> On native platforms, the local image URI is temporary. Use [`FileSystem.copy`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem#copydestination-1) to make a permanent copy of the image.

### `toggleRecordingAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Pauses or resumes the video recording. Only has an effect if there is an active recording. On `iOS`, this method only supported on `iOS` 18.

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
bounds| `BarcodeBounds`| The `BarcodeBounds` object. `bounds` in some case will be representing an empty rectangle. Moreover, `bounds` doesn't have to bound the whole barcode. For some types, they will represent the area used by the scanner.
cornerPoints| `BarcodePoint[]`| Corner points of the bounding box. `cornerPoints` is not always available and may be empty. On iOS, for `code39` and `pdf417` you don't get this value. Note: Corner points order is currently different across platforms. On Android, [Google MLKit's native order](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/mlkit/vision/barcode/common/Barcode#getCornerPoints\(\)) is used, which is `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomRight`, `bottomLeft`. On iOS, the order is `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`, `topLeft`, `topRight`. On Web, the order is `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomRight`, `bottomLeft` (matching Android/BarcodeDetector order).
data| `string`| The parsed information encoded in the barcode.
extra(optional)| `AndroidBarcode`| Only for: Android
Extra information returned by the specific type of barcode.

Web

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
additionalExif(optional)| `Record<string, any>`| Only for: AndroidiOS
Additional EXIF data to be included for the image. Only useful when `exif` option is set to `true`.
base64(optional)| `boolean`| Whether to also include the image data in Base64 format.
exif(optional)| `boolean`| Whether to also include the EXIF data for the image.
imageType(optional)| `ImageType`| Only for: Web
-
isImageMirror(optional)| `boolean`| Only for: Web
-
mirror(optional)| `boolean`|

> Deprecated: Use `mirror` prop on `CameraView` instead.

AndroidiOSWhen set to `true`, the output image will be flipped along the vertical axis when using the front camera.Default:`false`
onPictureSaved(optional)| `(picture: CameraCapturedPicture) => void`| A callback invoked when picture is saved. If set, the promise of this method will resolve immediately with no data after picture is captured. The data that it should contain will be passed to this callback. If displaying or processing a captured photo right after taking it is not your case, this callback lets you skip waiting for it to be saved.
pictureRef(optional)| `boolean`| Whether the camera should return an image ref that can be used directly in the `Image` component.
quality(optional)| `number`| Specify the compression quality from `0` to `1`. `0` means compress for small size, and `1` means compress for maximum quality.Default:`1`
scale(optional)| `number`| Only for: Web
-
shutterSound(optional)| `boolean`| To programmatically disable the camera shutter soundDefault:`true`
skipProcessing(optional)| `boolean`| If set to `true`, camera skips orientation adjustment and returns an image straight from the device's camera. If enabled, `quality` option is discarded (processing pipeline is skipped as a whole). Although enabling this option reduces image delivery time significantly, it may cause the image to appear in a wrong orientation in the `Image` component (at the time of writing, it does not respect EXIF orientation of the images).

> Note: Enabling `skipProcessing` would cause orientation uncertainty. `Image` component does not respect EXIF stored orientation information, that means obtained image would be displayed wrongly (rotated by 90°, 180° or 270°). Different devices provide different orientations. For example some Sony Xperia or Samsung devices don't provide correctly oriented images by default. To always obtain correctly oriented image disable `skipProcessing` option.
