`expo-cellular` provides information about the user's cellular service provider, such as its unique identifier, cellular connection type, and whether it allows VoIP calls on its network.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-cellular`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native a android project manually, then you need to add `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` permission to your project's AndroidManifest.xml. This permission is used for `TelephonyManager`.

android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Copy


    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />


This library does not require the more risky `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.

## API


    import * as Cellular from 'expo-cellular';


## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions to access the phone state. This uses both `Cellular.requestPermissionsAsync` and `Cellular.getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = Cellular.usePermissions();


## Methods

> Deprecated: Voip technology is not widely used and Google is removing it from the Android platform. This method will be removed in a future release.

### `Cellular.allowsVoipAsync()`

Android

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean | null>`

Returns if the carrier allows making VoIP calls on its network. On Android, this checks whether the system supports SIP-based VoIP API. See [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/sip/SipManager.html#isVoipSupported\(android.content.Context\)) to view more information.

On iOS, if you configure a device for a carrier and then remove the SIM card, this property retains the `boolean` value indicating the carrier’s policy regarding VoIP. If you then install a new SIM card, its VoIP policy `boolean` replaces the previous value of this property.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example


    await Cellular.allowsVoipAsync(); // true or false


### `Cellular.getCarrierNameAsync()`

Android

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null>`

Returns name of the user’s home cellular service provider. If the device has dual SIM cards, only the carrier for the currently active SIM card is returned.

On Android, this value is only available when the SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example


    await Cellular.getCarrierNameAsync(); // "T-Mobile" or "Verizon"


### `Cellular.getCellularGenerationAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<CellularGeneration>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with a `Cellular.CellularGeneration` enum value that represents the current cellular-generation type.

You need to check if the native permission has been accepted to obtain generation. If the permission is denied, `getCellularGenerationAsync` resolves with `Cellular.CellularGeneration.UNKNOWN`.

On web, this method uses [`navigator.connection.effectiveType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType) to detect the effective type of the connection using a combination of recently observed round-trip time and downlink values. See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API) to view browser compatibility.

Example


    await Cellular.getCellularGenerationAsync();
    // CellularGeneration.CELLULAR_4G


### `Cellular.getIsoCountryCodeAsync()`

Android

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null>`

Returns the ISO country code for the user’s cellular service provider.

On iOS, the value is `null` if any of the following apply:

  * The device is in airplane mode.
  * There is no SIM card in the device.
  * The device is outside of cellular service range.


On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example


    await Cellular.getIsoCountryCodeAsync(); // "us" or "au"


### `Cellular.getMobileCountryCodeAsync()`

Android

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null>`

Returns mobile country code (MCC) for the user’s current registered cellular service provider.

On Android, this value is only available when SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`. On iOS, the value may be null on hardware prior to iPhone 4S when in airplane mode. Furthermore, the value for this property is `null` if any of the following apply:

  * There is no SIM card in the device.
  * The device is outside of cellular service range.


On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example


    await Cellular.getMobileCountryCodeAsync(); // "310"


### `Cellular.getMobileNetworkCodeAsync()`

Android

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null>`

Returns the mobile network code (MNC) for the user’s current registered cellular service provider.

On Android, this value is only available when SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`. On iOS, the value may be null on hardware prior to iPhone 4S when in airplane mode. Furthermore, the value for this property is `null` if any of the following apply:

  * There is no SIM card in the device.
  * The device is outside of cellular service range.


On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example


    await Cellular.getMobileNetworkCodeAsync(); // "310"


### `Cellular.getPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing phone state.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

### `Cellular.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing the phone state.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

## Enums

Describes the current generation of the cellular connection. It is an enum with these possible values:

#### `UNKNOWN`

`CellularGeneration.UNKNOWN ＝ 0`

Either we are not currently connected to a cellular network or type could not be determined.

#### `CELLULAR_2G`

`CellularGeneration.CELLULAR_2G ＝ 1`

#### `CELLULAR_3G`

`CellularGeneration.CELLULAR_3G ＝ 2`

Currently connected to a 3G cellular network. Includes EHRPD, EVDO, HSPA, HSUPA, HSDPA, HSPAP, and UTMS type connections.

#### `CELLULAR_4G`
