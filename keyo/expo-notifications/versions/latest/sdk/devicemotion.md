`DeviceMotion` from `expo-sensors` provides access to the device motion and orientation sensors. All data is presented in terms of three axes that run through a device. According to portrait orientation: X runs from left to right, Y from bottom to top and Z perpendicularly through the screen from back to front.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-sensors`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `DeviceMotion` from `expo-sensor` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-sensors",
            {
              "motionPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion."
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`motionPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion"`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSMotionUsageDescription` permission message.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native ios project manually, then you need to configure `NSMotionUsageDescription` key in your native project to access `DeviceMotion` stats:

ios/[app]/Info.plist

Copy


    <key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion</string>


## API


    import { DeviceMotion } from 'expo-sensors';


## Constants

### `Gravity`

Android

iOS

Web

Type: `number`

Constant value representing standard gravitational acceleration for Earth (`9.80665` m/s^2).

## Classes

### `DeviceMotion`

Android

iOS

Web

Type: Class extends `[DeviceSensor](/versions/latest/sdk/sensors)<DeviceMotionMeasurement>`

A base class for subscribable sensors. The events emitted by this class are measurements specified by the parameter type `Measurement`.

DeviceMotion Properties

### `Gravity`

Android

iOS

Web

Type: `number` • Default: `ExponentDeviceMotion.Gravity`

Constant value representing standard gravitational acceleration for Earth (`9.80665` m/s^2).

DeviceMotion Methods

### `addListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `Listener<DeviceMotionMeasurement>`| A callback that is invoked when a device motion sensor update is available. When invoked, the listener is provided a single argument that is a `DeviceMotionMeasurement` object.




Subscribe for updates to the device motion sensor.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A subscription that you can call `remove()` on when you would like to unsubscribe the listener.

### `getListenerCount()`

Android

iOS

Web

Returns the registered listeners count.

Returns:

`number`

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

### `hasListeners()`

Android

iOS

Web

Returns boolean which signifies if sensor has any listeners registered.

Returns:

`boolean`

### `isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

> You should always check the sensor availability before attempting to use it.

Returns whether the accelerometer is enabled on the device.

On mobile web, you must first invoke `DeviceMotion.requestPermissionsAsync()` in a user interaction (i.e. touch event) before you can use this module. If the `status` is not equal to `granted` then you should inform the end user that they may have to open settings.

On web this starts a timer and waits to see if an event is fired. This should predict if the iOS device has the device orientation API disabled in Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access. Some devices will also not fire if the site isn't hosted with HTTPS as `DeviceMotion` is now considered a secure API. There is no formal API for detecting the status of `DeviceMotion` so this API can sometimes be unreliable on web.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` denoting the availability of device motion sensor.

### `removeAllListeners()`

Android

iOS

Web

Removes all registered listeners.

Returns:

`void`

> Deprecated: use subscription.remove() instead.

### `removeSubscription(subscription)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
subscription| `EventSubscription`




Returns:

`void`

### `requestPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

### `setUpdateInterval(intervalMs)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
intervalMs| `number`| Desired interval in milliseconds between sensor updates.

> Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), the system has a 200Hz limit for each sensor updates. If you need an update interval of greater than 200Hz, you should
>
>   * add `android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` to [app.json `permissions` field](/versions/latest/config/app#permissions)
>   * or if you are using an existing React Native project, add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS"/>` to AndroidManifest.xml.
>





Set the sensor update interval.

Returns:

`void`

## Interfaces

### `Subscription`

Android

iOS

Web

A subscription object that allows to conveniently remove an event listener from the emitter.

Subscription Methods

### `remove()`

Android

iOS

Web

Removes an event listener for which the subscription has been created. After calling this function, the listener will no longer receive any events from the emitter.

Returns:

`void`
