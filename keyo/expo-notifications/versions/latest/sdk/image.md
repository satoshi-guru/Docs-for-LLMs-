`expo-image` is a cross-platform React component that loads and renders images.

Main features:

  * Designed for speed
  * Support for many image formats (including animated ones)
  * Disk and memory caching
  * Supports [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh) and [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/) \- compact representations of a placeholder for an image
  * Transitioning between images when the source changes (no more flickering!)
  * Implements the CSS [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) properties (see [`contentFit`](/versions/latest/sdk/image#contentfit) and [`contentPosition`](/versions/latest/sdk/image#contentposition) props)
  * Uses performant [`SDWebImage`](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) and [`Glide`](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) under the hood

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-image`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure build-time settings for `expo-image` using its [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your app.json or app.config.js and rebuild the native project.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-image",
            {
              "disableLibdav1d": true
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`disableLibdav1d`| `false`| Only for: iOS
When `true`, skips adding the bundled `libavif/libdav1d` Pod. Use this when another dependency (such as `FFmpegKit`) already links `libdav1d`. Disabling the Pod removes AVIF image support on iOS unless another decoder is available.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you are not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native ios project manually, then set the shell environment variable `EXPO_IMAGE_DISABLE_LIBDAV1D=1` before running `pod install` to achieve the same effect. Alternatively, you can add `ENV['EXPO_IMAGE_DISABLE_LIBDAV1D'] ||= '0'` to the top of your `Podfile`.

## Usage


    import { Image } from 'expo-image';
    import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

    const blurhash =
      '|rF?hV%2WCj[ayj[a|j[az_NaeWBj@ayfRayfQfQM{M|azj[azf6fQfQfQIpWXofj[ayj[j[fQayWCoeoeaya}j[ayfQa{oLj?j[WVj[ayayj[fQoff7azayj[ayj[j[ayofayayayj[fQj[ayayj[ayfjj[j[ayjuayj[';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Image
            style={styles.image}
            source="https://picsum.photos/seed/696/3000/2000"
            placeholder={{ blurhash }}
            contentFit="cover"
            transition={1000}
          />
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
      image: {
        flex: 1,
        width: '100%',
        backgroundColor: '#0553',
      },
    });


### Using images from native resources

Images bundled in Xcode asset catalogs or Android drawable resources can be loaded by name with `source={{ uri: 'app_icon' }}`. Omit the file extension and provide image dimensions manually:


    import { Image } from 'expo-image';

    export default function AppIcon() {
      return <Image source={{ uri: 'app_icon' }} style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }} />;
    }


## API


    import { Image } from 'expo-image';


## Components

### `Image`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: `React.[PureComponent](https://react.dev/reference/react/PureComponent)<ImageProps>`

Some props are from React Native Image that Expo Image supports (more or less) for easier migration, but all of them are deprecated and might be removed in the future.

ImageProps

### `accessibilityLabel`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `string` • Default: `undefined`

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image. Sets the `alt` tag on web which is used for web crawlers and link traversal.

### `accessible`

Android

iOS

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single selectable component.

On Android, the `accessible` property will be translated into the native `isScreenReaderFocusable`, so it's only affecting the screen readers behaviour.

### `allowDownscaling`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Whether the image should be downscaled to match the size of the view container. Turning off this functionality could negatively impact the application's performance, particularly when working with large assets. However, it would result in smoother image resizing, and end-users would always have access to the highest possible asset quality.

Downscaling is never used when the `contentFit` prop is set to `none` or `fill`.

### `alt`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `string` • Default: `undefined`

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image. Sets the `alt` tag on web which is used for web crawlers and link traversal. Is an alias for `accessibilityLabel`.

### `autoplay`

Android

iOS

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Determines if an image should automatically begin playing if it is an animated image.

### `blurRadius`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `number` • Default: `0`

The radius of the blur in points, `0` means no blur effect. This effect is not applied to placeholders.

### `cachePolicy`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `'disk'`

Determines whether to cache the image and where: on the disk, in the memory or both.

  * `'none'` \- Image is not cached at all.

  * `'disk'` \- Image is queried from the disk cache if exists, otherwise it's downloaded and then stored on the disk.

  * `'memory'` \- Image is cached in memory. Might be useful when you render a high-resolution picture many times. Memory cache may be purged very quickly to prevent high memory usage and the risk of out of memory exceptions.

  * `'memory-disk'` \- Image is cached in memory, but with a fallback to the disk cache.


Acceptable values are: `'none'` | `'disk'` | `'memory'` | `'memory-disk'` | `null`

### `contentFit`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `ImageContentFit` • Default: `'cover'`

Determines how the image should be resized to fit its container. This property tells the image to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible". It mirrors the CSS [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property.

  * `'cover'` \- The image is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the container box. If the image's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.

  * `'contain'` \- The image is scaled down or up to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the container box.

  * `'fill'` \- The image is sized to entirely fill the container box. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit.

  * `'none'` \- The image is not resized and is centered by default. When specified, the exact position can be controlled with `contentPosition` prop.

  * `'scale-down'` \- The image is sized as if `none` or `contain` were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete image size.


### `contentPosition`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `ImageContentPosition` • Default: `'center'`

It is used together with `contentFit` to specify how the image should be positioned with x/y coordinates inside its own container. An equivalent of the CSS [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property.

### `decodeFormat`

Android

Optional • Type: `ImageDecodeFormat` • Default: `'argb'`

The format in which the image data should be decoded. It's not guaranteed that the platform will use the specified format.

  * `'argb'` \- The image is decoded into a 32-bit color space with alpha channel (<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#ARGB_8888>).

  * `'rgb'` \- The image is decoded into a 16-bit color space without alpha channel (<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#RGB_565>).


> Deprecated: Provides compatibility for [`defaultSource` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#defaultsource). Use `placeholder` prop instead.

### `defaultSource`

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `ImageSource` | `null`

### `draggable`

Web

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `undefined`

Whether the `img` element is draggable on web.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Enables Live Text interaction with the image. Check official [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/enabling_live_text_interactions_with_images) for more details.

### `enforceEarlyResizing`

iOS

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Force early resizing of the image to match the container size. This option helps to reduce the memory usage of the image view, especially when the image is larger than the container. It may affect the `resizeType` and `contentPosition` properties when the image view is resized dynamically.

> Deprecated: Provides compatibility for [`fadeDuration` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#fadeduration-android). Instead use `transition` with the provided duration.

### `fadeDuration`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `number`

### `focusable`

Android

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Whether this View should be focusable with a non-touch input device and receive focus with a hardware keyboard.

### `loading`

Web

Optional • Literal type: `string` • Default: `'eager'`

Sets the HTML [`loading`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#loading) attribute on the `<img>` element. Has no effect on native platforms.

  * `'lazy'` \- Defers loading until the image is near the viewport.
  * `'eager'` \- Loads the image immediately.


Acceptable values are: `'lazy'` | `'eager'`

> Deprecated: Provides compatibility for [`loadingIndicatorSource` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#loadingindicatorsource). Use `placeholder` prop instead.

### `loadingIndicatorSource`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `ImageSource` | `null`

### `onDisplay`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image view successfully rendered the source image.

### `onError`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `(event: ImageErrorEventData) => void`

Called on an image fetching error.

### `onLoad`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `(event: ImageLoadEventData) => void`

Called when the image load completes successfully.

### `onLoadEnd`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image load either succeeds or fails.

### `onLoadStart`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image starts to load.

### `onProgress`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `(event: ImageProgressEventData) => void`

Called when the image is loading. Can be called multiple times before the image has finished loading. The event object provides details on how many bytes were loaded so far and what's the expected total size.

### `placeholder`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union`

An image to display while loading the proper image and no image has been displayed yet or the source is unset.

> Note: The default value for placeholder's content fit is 'scale-down', which differs from the source image's default value. Using a lower-resolution placeholder may cause flickering due to scaling differences between it and the final image. To prevent this, you can set the `placeholderContentFit` to match the `contentFit` value.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `number` | `ImageSource` | `[SharedRef](/versions/v56.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedreftype)<'image', Record<never, never>>` | `ImageSource[]` | `string[]` | `null`

### `placeholderContentFit`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Type: `ImageContentFit` • Default: `'scale-down'`

Determines how the placeholder should be resized to fit its container. Available resize modes are the same as for the `contentFit` prop.

### `preferHighDynamicRange`

iOS 17.0+

tvOS 17.0+

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Controls whether the image view can leverage the extended dynamic range (EDR). Use this prop if you want to support high dynamic range (HDR) images, otherwise all images are rendered as standard dynamic range (SDR).

### `priority`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `'normal'`

Priorities for completing loads. If more than one load is queued at a time, the load with the higher priority will be started first. Priorities are considered best effort, there are no guarantees about the order in which loads will start or finish.

Acceptable values are: `'normal'` | `'low'` | `'high'` | `null`

### `recyclingKey`

Android

iOS

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

Changing this prop resets the image view content to blank or a placeholder before loading and rendering the final image. This is especially useful for any kinds of recycling views like [FlashList](https://github.com/shopify/flash-list) to prevent showing the previous source before the new one fully loads.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

> Deprecated: Provides compatibility for [`resizeMode` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#resizemode). Note that `"repeat"` option is not supported at all. Use the more powerful `contentFit` and `contentPosition` props instead.

### `resizeMode`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `string`

Acceptable values are: `'cover'` | `'contain'` | `'repeat'` | `'center'` | `'stretch'`

### `responsivePolicy`

Web

Optional • Literal type: `string` • Default: `'static'`

Controls the selection of the image source based on the container or viewport size on the web.

If set to `'static'`, the browser selects the correct source based on user's viewport width. Works with static rendering. Make sure to set the `'webMaxViewportWidth'` property on each source for best results. For example, if an image occupies 1/3 of the screen width, set the `'webMaxViewportWidth'` to 3x the image width. The source with the largest `'webMaxViewportWidth'` is used even for larger viewports.

If set to `'initial'`, the component will select the correct source during mount based on container size. Does not work with static rendering.

If set to `'live'`, the component will select the correct source on every resize based on container size. Does not work with static rendering.

Acceptable values are: `'live'` | `'initial'` | `'static'`

### `sfEffect`

iOS 17.0+

Optional • Literal type: `union`

SF Symbol effect animations. Can be a single effect string, an effect object, or an array of effect strings and/or objects.

Example


    // Single effect as string
    sfEffect="bounce"

    // Single effect as object with options
    sfEffect={{ effect: "bounce", repeat: -1, scope: "by-layer" }}

    // Array of mixed strings and objects
    sfEffect={["bounce", { effect: "pulse", repeat: -1 }]}


Acceptable values are: `SFSymbolEffect` | `null`

### `source`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union`

The image source, either a remote URL, a local file resource or a number that is the result of the `require()` function. When provided as an array of sources, the source that fits best into the container size and is closest to the screen scale will be chosen. In this case it is important to provide `width`, `height` and `scale` properties.

For SF Symbols (iOS), use the `sf:` prefix followed by the symbol name, for example, `sf:star.fill`.

> Note: For the complete list of SF Symbols, see [Apple's SF Symbols catalog](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) or the [`sf-symbols-typescript`](https://github.com/nandorojo/sf-symbols-typescript) library documentation.

Acceptable values are: `number` | `ImageSource` | `string & undefined` | `[SharedRef](/versions/v56.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedreftype)<'image', Record<never, never>>` | `ImageSource[]` | `string[]` | `sf:<symbol>`

### `tintColor`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

A color used to tint template images (a bitmap image where only the opacity matters). The color is applied to every non-transparent pixel, causing the image's shape to adopt that color. This effect is not applied to placeholders.

Note that `useImage` options parameter also has a `tintColor` field. When you have a `useImage` as a `source` use its `tintColor` instead.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `transition`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Describes how the image view should transition the contents when switching the image source.
If provided as a number, it is the duration in milliseconds of the `'cross-dissolve'` effect.

Acceptable values are: `number` | `ImageTransition` | `null`

### `useAppleWebpCodec`

iOS

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Whether to use the Apple's default WebP codec.

Set this prop to `false` to use the official standard-compliant [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp) codec for WebP images. The default implementation from Apple is faster and uses less memory but may render animated images with incorrect blending or play them at the wrong framerate.

> See: <https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#awebp-coder>

### `useImage(source, options, dependencies)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
source| `string | number | ImageSource`
options(optional)| `ImageLoadOptions`
dependencies(optional)| `DependencyList`




A hook that loads an image from the given source and returns a reference to the native image instance, or `null` until the first image is successfully loaded.

It loads a new image every time the `uri` of the provided source changes. To trigger reloads in some other scenarios, you can provide an additional dependency list.

Returns:

`ImageRef | null`

Example


    import { useImage, Image } from 'expo-image';
    import { Text } from 'react-native';

## Classes

### `ImageRef`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: Class extends `[SharedRef](/versions/v56.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedreftype)<'image'>`

An object that is a reference to a native image instance – [Drawable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable) on Android and [UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) on iOS. Instances of this class can be passed as a source to the Image component in which case the image is rendered immediately since its native representation is already available in the memory.

ImageRef Properties

### `height`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Read Only • Type: `number`

Logical height of the image. Multiply it by the value in the `scale` property to get the height in pixels.

### `isAnimated`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Optional • Read Only • Type: `boolean`

Whether the referenced image is an animated image.

### `mediaType`

iOS

Read Only • Literal type: `union`

Media type (also known as MIME type) of the image, based on its format. Returns `null` when the format is unknown or not supported.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `nativeRefType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: `string`

The type of the native reference.

### `scale`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Read Only • Type: `number`

On iOS, if you load an image from a file whose name includes the `@2x` modifier, the scale is set to 2.0. All other images are assumed to have a scale factor of 1.0. On Android, it calculates the scale based on the bitmap density divided by screen density.

On all platforms, if you multiply the logical size of the image by this value, you get the dimensions of the image in pixels.

### `width`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Read Only • Type: `number`

Logical width of the image. Multiply it by the value in the `scale` property to get the width in pixels.

## Types

### `ImageCacheConfig`

iOS

An object containing options for the `configureCache` function. See [`SDImageCacheConfig`](https://sdwebimage.github.io/documentation/sdwebimage/sdimagecacheconfig) for more information.

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
maxDiskSize(optional)| `number`| The maximum size of the disk cache, in bytes. Defaults to 0, which means there is no cache size limit.
maxMemoryCost(optional)| `number`| The maximum "total cost" of the in-memory image cache. The cost function is the bytes size held in memory, not simply the pixel count. For example, a typical ARGB8888 image uses 4 bytes (32 bits) per pixel. Defaults to 0, which means there is no memory cost limit.
maxMemoryCount(optional)| `number`| The maximum number of objects the in-memory image cache should hold. Defaults to 0, which means there is no memory count limit.

### `ImageContentPosition`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Specifies the position of the image inside its container. One value controls the x-axis and the second value controls the y-axis.

Additionally, it supports stringified shorthand form that specifies the edges to which to align the image content:
`'center'`, `'top'`, `'right'`, `'bottom'`, `'left'`, `'top center'`, `'top right'`, `'top left'`, `'right center'`, `'right top'`, `'right bottom'`, `'bottom center'`, `'bottom right'`, `'bottom left'`, `'left center'`, `'left top'`, `'left bottom'`.
If only one keyword is provided, then the other dimension is set to `'center'` (`'50%'`), so the image is placed in the middle of the specified edge.
As an example, `'top right'` is the same as `{ top: 0, right: 0 }` and `'bottom'` is the same as `{ bottom: 0, left: '50%' }`.

Type: `ImageContentPositionString` or `object` shaped as below:

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
right(optional)| `ImageContentPositionValue`| -
top(optional)| `ImageContentPositionValue`| -

Or `object` shaped as below:

left(optional)| `ImageContentPositionValue`| -

### `ImageContentPositionValue`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Literal Type: `union`

A value that represents the relative position of a single axis.

If `number`, it is a distance in points (logical pixels) from the respective edge.
If `string`, it must be a percentage value where `'100%'` is the difference in size between the container and the image along the respective axis, or `'center'` which is an alias for `'50%'` that is the default value. You can read more regarding percentages on the MDN docs for [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages) that describes this concept well.

Acceptable values are: `number` | `string` | `{number}%` | `{number}` | `'center'`

## Generating a blurhash on a server

Images can significantly improve the visual experience, however, they can also slow down app/page loading times due to their large file sizes. To overcome this, you can create placeholder images using blurhash algorithm that provides an immersive experience while deferring the loading of the actual picture until later.

This guide demonstrates how to create a blurhash of an uploaded image on the backend using JavaScript and Express.js. The same techniques and principles apply to other languages and server technologies.

Start by installing a few dependencies: [`multer`](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for handling multipart requests, [`sharp`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) for converting files to a data buffer, and the official [`blurhash` JavaScript package](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash/tree/master/TypeScript).

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npm install multer sharp blurhash`

Next, import all required functions from installed packages and initialize `multer`:


    // Multer is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.
    const multer = require('multer');
    // Sharp allows you to receive a data buffer from the uploaded image.
    const sharp = require('sharp');
    // Import the encode function from the blurhash package.
    const { encode } = require('blurhash');

    // Initialize `multer`.
    const upload = multer();


Assuming the `app` is a variable that holds a reference to the Express server, an endpoint can be created that accepts an image and returns a JSON response containing the generated blurhash.


    app.post('/blurhash', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
      const { file } = req;
      // If the file is not available we're returning with error.
      if (file === null) {
        res.status(400).json({ message: 'Image is missing' });
        return;
      }

      // Users can specify number of components in each axes.
      const componentX = req.body.componentX ?? 4;
      const componentY = req.body.componentY ?? 3;

      // We're converting provided image to a byte buffer.
      // Sharp currently supports multiple common formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF.
      const { data, info } = await sharp(file.buffer).ensureAlpha().raw().toBuffer({
        resolveWithObject: true,
      });

      const blurhash = encode(
        new Uint8ClampedArray(data),
        info.width,
        info.height,
        componentX,
        componentY
      );
      res.json({ blurhash });
    });


Additionally, the request can include two parameters: `componentX` and `componentY`, are passed through the algorithm. These values can be calculated or hard-coded on the server or specified by the user. However, they must be within the range of 1 to 9 and have an aspect ratio similar to the uploaded image. A value of 9 will give the best results but may take longer to generate the hash.

The process of generating a blurhash can be accomplished in various languages and server technologies, similar to the one using JavaScript. The key step is to locate an encoder for your chosen language, which can often be found in the [`woltapp/blurhash`](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash#implementations) repository. Once you have the encoder, you will need to obtain a representation of the image. Some libraries use a default image class (for example, the Swift implementation uses `UIImage`). In other cases, you will have to provide raw byte data. Make sure to check the encoder's documentation to confirm the expected data format.

> When working with raw byte data, ensure that the alpha layer is present (each pixel is represented by red, green, blue, and alpha values). Failing to do so will lead to errors such as "width and height must match the pixels array".
