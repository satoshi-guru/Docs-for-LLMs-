`expo-image-picker` provides access to the system's UI for selecting images and videos from the phone's library or taking a photo with the camera.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-image-picker`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

#### Known issues

iOS

On iOS, when an image (usually of a [higher resolution](https://openradar.me/49866214)) is picked from the camera roll, the result of the cropped image gives the wrong value for the cropped rectangle in some cases. Unfortunately, this issue is with the underlying `UIImagePickerController` due to a bug in the closed-source tools built into iOS.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-image-picker` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

By default `expo-image-picker` will add `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. You can remove it by setting the `microphonePermission` to false in the config below.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-image-picker",
            {
              "photosPermission": "The app accesses your photos to let you share them with your friends.",
              "colors": {
                "cropToolbarColor": "#000000"
              },
              "dark": {
                "colors": {
                  "cropToolbarColor": "#000000"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native ios project manually, then you need to add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to your ios/[app]/Info.plist:

Info.plist

Copy


    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your camera</string>
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to use your microphone</string>


## Usage

Image Picker

Copy

Open in Snack


    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { Alert, Button, Image, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
    import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

    export default function ImagePickerExample() {
      const [image, setImage] = useState<string | null>(null);

      const pickImage = async () => {
        // No permissions request is necessary for launching the image library.
        // Manually request permissions for videos on iOS when `allowsEditing` is set to `false`
        // and `videoExportPreset` is `'Passthrough'` (the default), ideally before launching the picker
        // so the app users aren't surprised by a system dialog after picking a video.
        // See "Invoke permissions for videos" sub section for more details.
        const permissionResult = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();

        if (!permissionResult.granted) {
          Alert.alert('Permission required', 'Permission to access the media library is required.');
          return;
        }

        let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
          mediaTypes: ['images', 'videos'],
          allowsEditing: true,
          aspect: [4, 3],
          quality: 1,
        });

        console.log(result);

        if (!result.canceled) {
          setImage(result.assets[0].uri);
        }
      };

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
          {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={styles.image} />}
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
      image: {
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
      },
    });


When you run this example and pick an image, you will see the image that you picked show up in your app, and a similar log will be shown in the console:


    {
      "assets": [
        {
          "assetId": "C166F9F5-B5FE-4501-9531",
          "base64": null,
          "duration": null,
          "exif": null,
          "fileName": "IMG.HEIC",
          "fileSize": 6018901,
          "height": 3025,
          "type": "image",
          "uri": "file:///data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/cache/cropped1814158652.jpg"
          "width": 3024
        }
      ],
      "canceled": false
    }


### Invoke permissions for videos

iOS

In SDK 54 and later, the default configuration keeps `allowsEditing` set to `false` and [`videoExportPreset`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#videoexportpreset) set to `'Passthrough'`. These settings return the original asset (including HEIC and AVIF files) instantly because the picker skips compression, but iOS requires media library permission to access the original file and displays a permission dialog immediately after the user selects a video.

To avoid showing permissions dialog after selection, manually request media library permissions before opening the picker via [`requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#imagepickerrequestmedialibrarypermissionsasyncwriteonly) or [`useMediaLibraryPermissions`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#usemedialibrarypermissionsoptions).

    import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';


## Hooks

### `useCameraPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions to access the camera. This uses both `requestCameraPermissionsAsync` and `getCameraPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useCameraPermissions();


### `useMediaLibraryPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<{  writeOnly: boolean }>`




Check or request permissions to access the media library. This uses both `requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` and `getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[MediaLibraryPermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useMediaLibraryPermissions();


## Methods

### `ImagePicker.getCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing camera.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type CameraPermissionResponse.

### `ImagePicker.getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
writeOnly(optional)| `boolean`| Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`Default:`false`




Checks user's permissions for accessing photos.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type MediaLibraryPermissionResponse.

### `ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Android system sometimes kills the `MainActivity` after the `ImagePicker` finishes. When this happens, we lose the data selected using the `ImagePicker`. However, you can retrieve the lost data by calling `getPendingResultAsync`. You can test this functionality by turning on `Don't keep activities` in the developer options.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<ImagePickerErrorResult | ImagePickerResult | null>`

  * On Android: a promise that resolves to an object of exactly same type as in `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` or `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync` if the `ImagePicker` finished successfully. Otherwise, an object of type `ImagePickerErrorResult`.
  * On other platforms: `null`


### `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
options(optional)| `ImagePickerOptions`| An `ImagePickerOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Display the system UI for taking a photo with the camera. Requires `Permissions.CAMERA`. On Android and iOS 10 `Permissions.CAMERA_ROLL` is also required. On mobile web, this must be called immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block the request without a warning.

> Note: Make sure that you handle `MainActivity` destruction on Android. See ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync. Notes for Web: The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press). Therefore, calling `launchCameraAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will not work as intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<ImagePickerResult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields. When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of the selected media assets which have a form of `ImagePickerAsset`.

### `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
options(optional)| `ImagePickerOptions`| An object extended by `ImagePickerOptions`.Default:`{}`




Display the system UI for choosing an image or a video from the phone's library. Requires `Permissions.MEDIA_LIBRARY` on iOS 10 only. On mobile web, this must be called immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block the request without a warning.

Animated GIFs support: On Android, if the selected image is an animated GIF, the result image will be an animated GIF too if and only if `quality` is explicitly set to `1.0` and `allowsEditing` is set to `false`. Otherwise compression and/or cropper will pick the first frame of the GIF and return it as the result (on Android the result will be a PNG). On iOS, both quality and cropping are supported.

> Notes for Web: The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press). Therefore, calling `launchImageLibraryAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will not work as intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<ImagePickerResult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields. When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of the selected media assets which have a form of `ImagePickerAsset`.

### `ImagePicker.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing camera. This does nothing on web because the browser camera is not used.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type CameraPermissionResponse.

### `ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
writeOnly(optional)| `boolean`| Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`Default:`false`




Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing user's photo. This method does nothing on web.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<MediaLibraryPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type MediaLibraryPermissionResponse.

  * `'image'` \- for images.
  * `'video'` \- for videos.
  * `'livePhoto'` \- for live photos. (iOS only)
  * `'pairedVideo'` \- for videos paired with photos, which can be combined to create a live photo. (iOS only)
  * `null` \- when the type could not be determined. This is rare but can happen with some Android ContentProviders.


uri| `string`| URI to the local image or video file (usable as the source of an `Image` element, in the case of an image) and `width` and `height` specify the dimensions of the media.
