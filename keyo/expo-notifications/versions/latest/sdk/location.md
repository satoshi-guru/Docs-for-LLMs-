`expo-location` allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-location`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-location` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-location",
            {
              "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location."
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` permission message.
`locationAlwaysPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"`| Deprecated • Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` permission message.
`locationWhenInUsePermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` permission message.
`isIosBackgroundLocationEnabled`| `false`| Only for: iOS
A boolean to enable `location` in the `UIBackgroundModes` in Info.plist.
`isAndroidBackgroundLocationEnabled`| `false`| Only for: Android
A boolean to enable the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission.
`isAndroidForegroundServiceEnabled`| -| Only for: Android
A boolean to enable the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`. Defaults to `true` if `isAndroidBackgroundLocationEnabled` is `true`, otherwise `false`.
`androidForegroundServiceIcon`| -| Only for: Android
Local path to an image to use as the icon for the foreground service started by `startLocationUpdatesAsync`. 96x96 all-white png with transparency. If not set, falls back to the `notification_icon` drawable (if configured via `expo-notifications` config plugin), then to the app launcher icon. The launcher icon is full-color and may render as a solid white square since Android requires notification icons to be monochrome.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native ios project manually, then you need to add the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` and `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` keys to your project's ios/[app]/Info.plist:


    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>


### Background location

Background location allows your app to receive location updates while it is running in the background and includes both location updates and region monitoring through geofencing. This feature is subject to platform API limitations and system constraints:

  * Background location will stop if the user terminates the app.
  * Background location resumes if the user restarts the app.
  * Android

A terminated app will not automatically restart when a location or geofencing event occurs due to platform limitations.
  * iOS

The system will restart the terminated app when a new geofence event occurs.


> On Android, the result of removing an app from the recent apps list varies by device vendor. For example, some implementations treat removing an app from the recent apps list as killing it. Read more about these differences here: <https://dontkillmyapp.com>.

### Background location configuration

iOS

To be able to run background location on iOS, you need to add the `location` value to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's Info.plist file.

If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation), the required `UIBackgroundModes` configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your Expo.plist file:

ios/project-name/Supporting/Expo.plist

Copy


    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
      <array>
        <string>location</string>
      </array>


### Background location methods

To use Background Location methods, the following requirements apply:

  * Location permissions must be granted.
  * Background location task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).
  * iOS

`"location"` background mode must be specified in Info.plist file. See [Background location configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/location#background-location-configuration).
  * iOS

You must use a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to use background location since it is not supported in the Expo Go app.


### Geofencing methods

To use Geofencing methods, the following requirements apply:

  * Location permissions must be granted.
  * The Geofencing task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).


When using Geofencing, the following platform differences apply:

  * Android

You are allowed [up to 100](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/geofencing) active geofences per app.
  * iOS

Expo Location will report the initial state of the registered geofence(s) at app startup.
  * iOS

There is a [limit of 20](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) `regions` that can be simultaneously monitored.


### Background permissions

To use location tracking or Geofencing in the background, you must request the appropriate permissions:

  * On Android, you must request both foreground and background permissions.
  * On iOS, it must be granted with the `Always` option using [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync).


Expo and iOS permissions

iOS permissions are divided into the two categories `When In Use` and `Always` and maps to Expo's foreground and background location permissions requested via:

  * [`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) maps to `When In Use`
  * [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) maps to `Always`


> Note: When requesting `When In Use` authorization, the user can grant temporary access by selecting `Allow Once` in the system permission dialog. This authorization will be valid only for the current app session and is automatically revoked when the app is closed.

Detecting "Allow Once" versus "Allow While Using the App"

Unfortunately, iOS does not provide a way to detect whether the user selected `Allow Once` or `Allow While Using the App`. Both responses result in `When In Use` authorization.

If the user selected `Allow Once` and you subsequently call [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) in the same session, the system will not show another prompt. Instead, the request will silently fail, and the returned background permission status will be denied.

Handling "Allow Once" scenarios

If you suspect the user selected `Allow Once` and needs to request background permissions, they must manually enable background location in the Settings app. You can use `Linking` to open the Settings app within your app:


    import { Linking } from 'react-native';

    function openSettings() {
      Linking.openURL('app-settings:');
    }


Incremental permission requests

It is possible to request foreground location access first and then ask for background location access later. This can improve the user experience by requesting permissions only when necessary.

Requesting Background Permissions directly

If you call [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) without first requesting foreground permissions, iOS treats it as a request for both `When In Use` and `Always` authorization. The system will then prompt the user for `When In Use` access, and the `Always` authorization prompt will be displayed when the system determines that `Always` authorization is required.

Remember that the user has the option of granting your app `When In Use` authorization instead. You must always be prepared to run with `When In Use` permission.

## Deferred locations

When using background locations, you can configure the location manager to defer updates. This helps save battery by reducing update frequency. You can set updates to trigger only after the device has moved a certain distance or after a specified time interval.

Deferred updates are configured through [`LocationTaskOptions`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) using the [`deferredUpdatesDistance`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions), [`deferredUpdatesInterval`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) and [`deferredTimeout`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) properties.

> Deferred locations apply only when the app is in the background.

## Usage

If you're using the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, ensure that [Location is enabled](/versions/latest/sdk/location#enable-emulator-location).

## Enable emulator location

### Android Emulator

Open Android Studio, and launch the Android Emulator. Inside it, go to Settings > Location and enable Use location.

If you don't receive the locations in the emulator, you may have to turn off the Improve Location Accuracy setting. This will turn off Wi-Fi location and only use GPS. Then you can manipulate the location with GPS data through the emulator.

For Android 12 and higher, go to Settings > Location > Location Services > Google Location Accuracy, and turn off Improve Location Accuracy. For Android 11 and lower, go to Settings > Location > Advanced > Google Location Accuracy, and turn off Google Location Accuracy.

### iOS Simulator

With Simulator open, go to Features > Location and choose any option besides None.

## API


    import * as Location from 'expo-location';


## Hooks

### `useBackgroundPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions for the background location. This uses both `requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync` and `getBackgroundPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useBackgroundPermissions();


### `useForegroundPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions for the foreground location. This uses both `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync` and `getForegroundPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[LocationPermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<LocationPermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<LocationPermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useForegroundPermissions();


## Methods

### `Location.enableNetworkProviderAsync()`

Android

Asks the user to turn on high accuracy location mode which enables network provider that uses Google Play services to improve location accuracy and location-based services.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise resolving as soon as the user accepts the dialog. Rejects if denied.

### `Location.geocodeAsync(address)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
address| `string`| A string representing address, eg. `"Baker Street London"`.




Geocode an address string to latitude-longitude location.

On Android, you must request location permissions with `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync` before geocoding can be used.

> Note: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error, so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<LocationGeocodedLocation[]>`

A promise which fulfills with an array (in most cases its size is 1) of `LocationGeocodedLocation` objects.

### `Location.getBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the background.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type `PermissionResponse`.

### `Location.getCurrentPositionAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `LocationOptions`




Requests for one-time delivery of the user's current location. Depending on given `accuracy` option it may take some time to resolve, especially when you're inside a building.

> Note: Calling it causes the location manager to obtain a location fix which may take several seconds. Consider using `getLastKnownPositionAsync` if you expect to get a quick response and high accuracy is not required.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<LocationObject>`

A promise which fulfills with an object of type `LocationObject`.

### `Location.getForegroundPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the foreground.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<LocationPermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type `LocationPermissionResponse`.

### `Location.getHeadingAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Gets the current heading information from the device. To simplify, it calls `watchHeadingAsync` and waits for a couple of updates, and then returns the one that is accurate enough.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<LocationHeadingObject>`

taskName| `string`| Name of the task that will be called when the device enters or exits from specified regions.
regions(optional)| `LocationRegion[]`| Array of region objects to be geofenced.Default:`[]`




Starts geofencing for given regions. When the new event comes, the task with specified name will be called with the region that the device enter to or exit from. If you want to add or remove regions from already running geofencing task, you can just call `startGeofencingAsync` again with the new array of regions.

#### Task parameters

Geofencing task will be receiving following data:

## Permissions

### Android

> Foreground and background services are not available in Expo Go for Android. Instead, we recommend using a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to avoid limitations.

When you install the `expo-location` module, it automatically adds the following permissions:

  * `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: for approximate device location
  * `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: for precise device location


The following permissions are optional:

  * `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`: to be able to access location while the app is open but backgrounded. `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` is only required as of Android 14. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to [submit your app for review and request access to use the foreground service permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?hl=en).
  * `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`: to be able to access location while the app is backgrounded or closed. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to [submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150?hl=en).


Android Permission| Description
---|---
`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`| Allows an app to access approximate location.

> Alternatively, you might want `[ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)`.

`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`| Allows an app to access precise location.

> Alternatively, you might want `[ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)`.

`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`| Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

> Allows a regular application to use `[Service.startForeground](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground\(int,%20android.app.Notification\))`.

`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`| Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location".

> Allows a regular application to use `[Service.startForeground](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground\(int,%20android.app.Notification\))` with the type "location".

`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`| Allows an app to access location in the background.

> If you're requesting this permission, you must also request either `[ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)` or `[ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)`. Requesting this permission by itself doesn't give you location access.

#### Excluding a permission

> Note: Excluding a required permission from a module in your app can break the functionality corresponding to that permission. Always make sure to include all permissions a module is dependent on.

When your Expo project doesn't benefit from having particular permission included, you can omit it. For example, if your application doesn't need access to the precise location, you can exclude the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.

Another example can be stated using [available location accuracies](/versions/latest/sdk/location#accuracy). Android defines the approximate location accuracy estimation within about 3 square kilometers, and the precise location accuracy estimation within about 50 meters. For example, if the location accuracy value is [Low](/versions/latest/sdk/location#low), you can exclude `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. To learn more about levels of location accuracies, see [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions#accuracy).

To learn more on how to exclude permission, see [Excluding Android permissions](/guides/permissions#excluding-android-permissions).

### iOS

The following usage description keys are used by this library:

Info.plist Key| Description
---|---
`NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`| A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s location information at all times.
`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`| A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user's location at all times.DeprecatedFor apps deployed to targets in iOS 11 and later, use NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription instead.
`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`| A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s location information while the app is running in the foreground.

`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` is deprecated in favor of `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` from iOS 11.
