`expo-mail-composer` allows you to compose and send emails quickly and easily using the OS UI. This module can't be used on iOS Simulators since you can't sign into a mail account on them.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-mail-composer`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## API


    import * as MailComposer from 'expo-mail-composer';


## Methods

### `MailComposer.composeAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Web

Parameter| Type
---|---
options| `MailComposerOptions`




Opens a mail modal for iOS and a mail app intent for Android and fills the fields with provided data. On iOS you will need to be signed into the Mail app.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<MailComposerResult>`

A promise fulfilled with an object containing a `status` field that specifies whether an email was sent, saved, or cancelled. Android does not provide this info, so the status is always set as if the email were sent.

### `MailComposer.getClients()`

Android

iOS

Web

Retrieves a list of available email clients installed on the device. This can be used to present options to the user for sending emails through their preferred email client, or to open an email client so the user can access their mailbox — for example, to open a confirmation email sent by your app.

Returns:

`MailClient[]`

An array of available mail clients.

### `MailComposer.isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

Web

Determine if the `MailComposer` API can be used in this app.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

A promise resolves to `true` if the API can be used, and `false` otherwise.

  * Returns `true` when the device has a default email setup for sending mail.
  * Can return `false` on iOS if an MDM profile is setup to block outgoing mail. If this is the case, you may want to use the Linking API instead.
  * Always returns `true` in the browser.
