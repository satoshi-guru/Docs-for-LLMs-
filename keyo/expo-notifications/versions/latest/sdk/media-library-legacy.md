> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Use this file to discover all available pages.

> The legacy version of the MediaLibrary API is included in the `expo-media-library` library. It can be used alongside the class-based `expo-media-library` API, which is exposed from the root import. To use the legacy API, import it from `expo-media-library/legacy`.

`expo-media-library` provides access to the user's media library, allowing them to access their existing images and videos from your app, as well as save new ones. You can also subscribe to any updates made to the user's media library.

> Android allows full access to the media library (which is the purpose of this package) only for applications needing broad access to photos. See [Details on Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180).

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-media-library`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-media-library` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-media-library",
            {
              "photosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos.",
              "savePhotosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos.",
              "isAccessMediaLocationEnabled": true,
              "granularPermissions": ["audio", "photo"]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`photosPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos."`| Only for: iOS
Sets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message in Info.plist.
`savePhotosPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos."`| Only for: iOS
Sets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` permission message in Info.plist.
`preventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert`| `false`| Only for: iOS
Prevents the automatic limited access alert from being shown when the user has limited access to the photo library. Useful for apps that want to access only the limited photo library without having iOS forcibly show the alert.
`isAccessMediaLocationEnabled`| `false`| Only for: Android
Sets whether or not to request the `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission on Android.
`granularPermissions`| `["photo", "video", "audio"]`| Only for: Android
Sets which `GranularPermission` values to include, determining which media permissions (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`) will be added to the Android manifest. Matches the behavior of the runtime API.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native android and ios projects manually, then you need to add following permissions and configuration to your native projects:

Android

  * To access asset location (latitude and longitude EXIF tags), add `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission to your project's android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION" />


  * [Scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#scoped-storage) is available from Android 10. To make `expo-media-library` work with scoped storage, you need to add the following configuration to your android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

        <manifest ... >
          <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
        </manifest>



iOS

  * Add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, and `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` keys to your project's ios/[app]/Info.plist:

        <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your photos</string>
        <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>

## Known limitations

### Empty albums

Due to system limitations on Android, it is impossible to create empty albums. It is necessary to either pass an existing asset to add to the album or a URI of a local resource, which will be used to create a new asset inside the album.

### Moving assets between albums

Android 11 introduced permission changes that make the operation of moving assets between albums require confirmation from the user every time. Therefore, when creating a new asset, instead of creating the asset and then moving it to the album, it is recommended to pass the `album` parameter to the [`createAssetAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library-legacy#medialibrarycreateassetasynclocaluri-album) method, which will automatically add the asset to the album without the need for user confirmation.

### Wrong orientation of images

On Android, when using `getAssetsAsync` without `resolveWithFullInfo: true`, image orientation may be incorrect because EXIF data (which includes orientation) is only read when that option is enabled.

## API


    import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library/legacy';


## Component

### `getAlbumsAsync`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<AlbumsOptions>`

Queries for user-created albums in media gallery.

## Constants

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<{  granularPermissions: GranularPermission[],  writeOnly: boolean }>`




Check or request permissions to access the media library. This uses both `requestPermissionsAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = MediaLibrary.usePermissions();


## Methods

### `MediaLibrary.addAssetsToAlbumAsync(assets, album, copy)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
assets| `AssetRef | AssetRef[]`| An array of Asset or their IDs.
album| `AlbumRef`| An Album or its ID.
copy(optional)| `boolean`| Android only. Whether to copy assets to the new album instead of move them. Defaults to `true`.Default:`true`




Adds array of assets to the album.

On Android, by default it copies assets from the current album to provided one, however it's also possible to move them by passing `false` as `copyAssets` argument. In case they're copied you should keep in mind that `getAssetsAsync` will return duplicated assets.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Returns promise which fulfils with `true` if the assets were successfully added to the album.

### `MediaLibrary.albumNeedsMigrationAsync(album)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
album| `AlbumRef`| An Album or its ID.




Checks if the album should be migrated to a different location. In other words, it checks if the application has the write permission to the album folder. If not, it returns `true`, otherwise `false`.

> Note: For Android below R, web or iOS, this function always returns `false`.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with `true` if the album should be migrated.

### `MediaLibrary.createAlbumAsync(albumName, asset, copyAsset, initialAssetLocalUri)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
albumName| `string`| Name of the album to create.
asset(optional)| `AssetRef`| An Asset or its ID. On Android you either need to provide an asset or a localUri.
copyAsset(optional)| `boolean`| Android Only. Whether to copy asset to the new album instead of move it. This parameter is ignored if `asset` was not provided. Defaults to `true`.Default:`true`
initialAssetLocalUri(optional)| `string`| A URI to the local media file, which will be used to create the initial asset inside the album. It must contain an extension. On Android it must be a local path, so it must start with `file:///`. If the `asset` was provided, this parameter will be ignored.




Creates an album with given name and initial asset. The asset parameter is required on Android, since it's not possible to create empty album on this platform. On Android, by default it copies given asset from the current album to the new one, however it's also possible to move it by passing `false` as `copyAsset` argument. In case it's copied you should keep in mind that `getAssetsAsync` will return duplicated asset.

> On Android, it's not possible to create an empty album. You must provide an existing asset to copy or move into the album or an uri of a local file, which will be used to create an initial asset for the album.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<Album>`

### `MediaLibrary.migrateAlbumIfNeededAsync(album)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
album| `AlbumRef`| An Album or its ID.




Moves album content to the special media directories on Android R or above if needed. Those new locations are in line with the Android `scoped storage` \- so your application won't lose write permission to those directories in future.

This method does nothing if:

  * app is running on iOS, web or Android below R
  * app has write permission to the album folder


The migration is possible when the album contains only compatible files types. For instance, movies and pictures are compatible with each other, but music and pictures are not. If automatic migration isn't possible, the function rejects. In that case, you can use methods from the `expo-file-system` to migrate all your files manually.

#### Why do you need to migrate files?

Android R introduced a lot of changes in storage system. Now applications can't save anything to the root directory. The only available locations are from the `MediaStore` API. Unfortunately, the media library stored albums in folders for which, because of those changes, the application doesn't have permissions anymore. However, it doesn't mean you need to migrate all your albums. If your application doesn't add assets to albums, you don't have to migrate. Everything will work as it used to. You can read more about scoped storage in [the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage).

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise which fulfils to `void`.

### `MediaLibrary.presentPermissionsPickerAsync(mediaTypes)`

Android 14+

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
mediaTypes(optional)| `MediaTypeFilter[]`| Limits the type(s) of media that the user will be granting access to. By default, a list that shows both photos and videos is presented.




Allows the user to update the assets that your app has access to. The system modal is only displayed if the user originally allowed only `limited` access to their media library, otherwise this method is a no-op.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise that either rejects if the method is unavailable, or resolves to `void`.

> Note: This method doesn't inform you if the user changes which assets your app has access to. That information is only exposed by iOS, and to obtain it, you need to subscribe for updates to the user's media library using `addListener()`. If `hasIncrementalChanges` is `false`, the user changed their permissions.

### `MediaLibrary.removeAssetsFromAlbumAsync(assets, album)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
assets| `AssetRef | AssetRef[]`| An array of Asset or their IDs.
album| `AlbumRef`| An Album or its ID.




Removes given assets from album.

On Android, album will be automatically deleted if there are no more assets inside.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Returns promise which fulfils with `true` if the assets were successfully removed from the album.

### `MediaLibrary.removeSubscription(subscription)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
subscription| `EventSubscription`




Returns:

`void`

### `MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync(writeOnly, granularPermissions)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
writeOnly(optional)| `boolean`| Default:`false`
granularPermissions(optional)| `GranularPermission[]`| A list of `GranularPermission` values. This parameter has an effect only on Android 13 and newer. By default, `expo-media-library` will ask for all possible permissions.

> When using granular permissions with a custom config plugin configuration, make sure that all the requested permissions are included in plugin.




Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing media in user's media library.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that fulfils with `PermissionResponse` object.

### `MediaLibrary.saveToLibraryAsync(localUri)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
localUri| `string`| A URI to the image or video file. It must contain an extension. On Android it must be a local path, so it must start with `file:///`.




Saves the file at given `localUri` to the user's media library. Unlike `createAssetAsync()`, This method doesn't return created asset. On iOS 11+, it's possible to use this method without asking for `CAMERA_ROLL` permission, however then yours `Info.plist` should have `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `MediaLibrary.setAssetFavoriteAsync(asset, isFavorite)`

An array of MediaSubtypes or a single `MediaSubtype`.
mediaType(optional)| `MediaTypeValue[] | MediaTypeValue`| An array of MediaTypeValues or a single `MediaTypeValue`.Default:`MediaType.photo`
resolveWithFullInfo(optional)| `boolean`| Only for: Android
Whether to resolve full info for the assets during the query. This is useful to get the full EXIF data for images. It can fix the orientation of the image.Default:`false`
sortBy(optional)| `SortByValue[] | SortByValue`| An array of `SortByValue`s or a single `SortByValue` value. By default, all keys are sorted in descending order, however you can also pass a pair `[key, ascending]` where the second item is a `boolean` value that means whether to use ascending order.

## Permissions

### Android

The following permissions are added automatically through this library's AndroidManifest.xml:

Android Permission| Description
---|---
`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`| Allows an application to read from external storage.
`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`| Allows an application to write to external storage.
`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`| Allows an application to read image files from external storage.
`READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`| Allows an application to read video files from external storage.
`READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`| Allows an application to read audio files from external storage.
`READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED`| Allows an application to read image or video files from external storage that a user has selected via the permission prompt photo picker.

> Apps can check this permission to verify that a user has decided to use the photo picker, instead of granting access to `[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)` or `[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`. It does not prevent apps from accessing the standard photo picker manually. This permission should be requested alongside `[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)` and/or `[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`, depending on which type of media is desired.
