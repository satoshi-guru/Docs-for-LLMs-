`expo-notifications` provides an API to fetch push notification tokens and to present, schedule, receive and respond to notifications.

[Notification guidesDo not miss our guides on how to set up, send, and handle push notifications.](/push-notifications/overview)

> Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by `expo-notifications` is unavailable in Expo Go on Android from SDK 53. A [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) is required to use push notifications. Local notifications (in-app notifications) remain available in Expo Go.

## Features

  * Schedule a one-off notification for a specific date or some time from now
  * Schedule a notification repeating in some time interval (or a calendar date match on iOS)
  * Get and set the application badge icon number
  * Obtain a native device push token, so you can send push notifications with FCM (for Android) and APNs (for iOS)
  * Obtain an Expo push token, so you can send push notifications with [Expo Push Service](/push-notifications/sending-notifications)
  * Listen to incoming notifications in the foreground and background
  * Listen to interactions with notifications
  * Handle notifications when the app is in the foreground
  * Imperatively dismiss notifications from Notification Center/tray
  * Create, update, and delete [Android notification channels](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/channels)
  * Set custom icon and color for notifications on Android


## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-notifications`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.




Then proceed to [configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configuration) to set up the [config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#app-config) and obtain the [credentials](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#credentials) for push notifications.

### Known issues

Android

When launching the app from a push notification in Android development builds, the splash screen may fail to display correctly about 70% of the time. The icon and fade animation may not appear as expected.

  * Icon may be missing
  * Fade animation may not run
  * Only the background color may flash briefly


This issue only affects debug builds and does not occur in release builds. To workaround it, test notification launches in release mode (`npx expo run:android --variant release`) for accurate behavior.

## Usage

Check out the example Snack below to see Notifications in action. Push notifications work on physical devices, Android emulators with Google Play services, and iOS simulators on Xcode 14 or later (macOS 13+, iOS 16+).

### Present a local (in-app) notification to the user


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    // First, set the handler that will cause the notification
    // to show the alert
    Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
      handleNotification: async () => ({
        shouldPlaySound: false,
        shouldSetBadge: false,
        shouldShowBanner: true,
        shouldShowList: true,
      }),
    });

    // Second, call scheduleNotificationAsync()
    Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
      content: {
        title: 'Look at that notification',
        body: "I'm so proud of myself!",
      },
      trigger: null,
    });


### Handle push notifications with navigation

If you'd like to deep link to a specific screen in your app when you receive a push notification, you can configure either of Expo's navigation systems to do that.

Expo Router

React Navigation

You can use Expo Router's [built-in deep linking](/router/basics/core-concepts#2-all-pages-have-a-url) to handle incoming URLs from push notifications. Simply configure the root layout to listen for incoming and initial notification events.

app/_layout.tsx

Copy


    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
    import { router } from 'expo-router';

    function useNotificationObserver() {
      useEffect(() => {
        function redirect(notification: Notifications.Notification) {
          const url = notification.request.content.data?.url;
          if (typeof url === 'string') {
            router.push(url);
          }
        }

        const response = Notifications.getLastNotificationResponse();
        if (response?.notification) {
          redirect(response.notification);
        }

        const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
          redirect(response.notification);
        });

        return () => {
          subscription.remove();
        };
      }, []);
    }

    export default function Layout() {
      useNotificationObserver();

      return <Slot />;
    }


React Navigation's manual [linking configuration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container#linking) can be configured to handle incoming redirects from push notifications:

App.tsx

Copy


    import React from 'react';
    import { Linking } from 'react-native';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
    import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <NavigationContainer
          linking={{
            config: {
              // Configuration for linking
            },
            async getInitialURL() {
              // First, you may want to do the default deep link handling
              // Check if app was opened from a deep link
              const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();

              if (url != null) {
                return url;
              }

              // Handle URL from expo push notifications
              const response = Notifications.getLastNotificationResponse();

              return response?.notification.request.content.data.url;
            },
            subscribe(listener) {
              const onReceiveURL = ({ url }: { url: string }) => listener(url);

              // Listen to incoming links from deep linking
              const eventListenerSubscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);

              // Listen to expo push notifications
              const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
                const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;

                // Any custom logic to see whether the URL needs to be handled
                //...

                // Let React Navigation handle the URL
                listener(url);
              });

              return () => {
                // Clean up the event listeners
                eventListenerSubscription.remove();
                subscription.remove();
              };
            },
          }}>
          {/* Your app content */}
        </NavigationContainer>
      );
    }

## Configuration

### Credentials

Follow the [setup guide](/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup#get-credentials-for-development-builds).

### App config

To configure `expo-notifications`, use the built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) in the app config (app.json or app.config.js) for [EAS Build](/build/introduction) or with `npx expo run:[android|ios]`. The plugin allows you to configure the following properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect:

### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`icon`| -| Only for: Android
Local path to an image to use as the icon for push notifications. 96x96 all-white png with transparency.
`color`| `#ffffff`| Only for: Android
Tint color for the push notification image when it appears in the notification tray.
`defaultChannel`| -| Only for: Android
Default channel for FCMv1 notifications.
`sounds`| -| Array of local paths to sound files (.wav recommended) that can be used as custom notification sounds. Sound will not be played when focus mode does not permit it or silent mode is on.
`enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications`| `false`| Only for: iOS
Whether to enable background remote notifications, as described in [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app). This updates the `UIBackgroundModes` key in the `Info.plist` to include `remote-notification`.

Here is an example of using the config plugin in the app config file:

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-notifications",
            {
              "icon": "./local/assets/notification_icon.png",
              "color": "#ffffff",
              "defaultChannel": "default",
              "sounds": [
                "./local/assets/notification_sound.wav",
                "./local/assets/notification_sound_other.wav"
              ],
              "enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications": false
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


> The iOS APNs entitlement is _always_ set to 'development'. Xcode automatically changes this to 'production' in the archive generated by a release build. [Learn more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42293632/4047926).

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Learn how to configure the native projects in the [installation instructions in the `expo-notifications` repository](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-notifications#installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

## Permissions

### Android

  * On Android, this module requires permission to subscribe to the device boot. It's used to set up scheduled notifications when the device (re)starts. The `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission is added automatically through the library's AndroidManifest.xml.

  * Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), to schedule a notification that triggers at an exact time, you need to add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>` to AndroidManifest.xml. Read more about the [exact alarm permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission).

  * On Android 13, app users must opt-in to receive notifications via a permissions prompt automatically triggered by the operating system. This prompt will not appear until at least one notification channel is created. The `setNotificationChannelAsync` must be called before `getDevicePushTokenAsync` or `getExpoPushTokenAsync` to obtain a push token. You can read more about the new notification permission behavior for Android 13 in the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission#new-apps).


Android Permission| Description
---|---
`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`| Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting.

> Allows an application to receive the `[Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED)` that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. If you don't request this permission, you will not receive the broadcast at that time. Though holding this permission does not have any security implications, it can have a negative impact on the user experience by increasing the amount of time it takes the system to start and allowing applications to have themselves running without the user being aware of them. As such, you must explicitly declare your use of this facility to make that visible to the user.

`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`| Allows applications to use exact alarm APIs.

### iOS

No usage description is required, see [notification-related permissions](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#fetch-information-about-notifications-related-permissions).

### Interpret the iOS permissions response

On iOS, permissions for sending notifications are a little more granular than they are on Android. This is why you should rely on the `NotificationPermissionsStatus`'s `ios.status` field, instead of the root `status` field.

This value will be one of the following, accessible under `Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus`:

  * `NOT_DETERMINED`: The user hasn't yet made a choice about whether the app is allowed to schedule notifications
  * `DENIED`: The app isn't authorized to schedule or receive notifications
  * `AUTHORIZED`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications
  * `PROVISIONAL`: The app is provisionally authorized to post noninterruptive user notifications
  * `EPHEMERAL`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications for a limited amount of time


## Notification events listeners

Notification events include incoming notifications, interactions your users perform with notifications (this can be tapping on a notification, or interacting with it via [notification categories](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#manage-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)), and rare occasions when your notifications may be dropped.

Several listeners are exposed and documented in the [Push notification behaviors](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#push-notification-behaviors) section.

## Headless (Background) notifications

See the [definition](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#headless-background-notifications) of Headless Background Notifications in the [What you need to know](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know) guide.

To handle notifications while the app is in the background or not running, you need to do the following:

  * Add `expo-task-manager` package to your project.
  * [Configure background notifications](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#background-notification-configuration).
  * In your application code, set up a [background task](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#registertaskasynctaskname) to run when the notification is received.


Then send a push notification which:

  * Contains only the `data` key (no `title`, `body`)
  * Has `_contentAvailable: true` set for iOS — see the [Expo push notification service payload format](/push-notifications/sending-notifications#message-request-format)


### Background notification configuration

iOS

To be able to use headless (background) notifications push notifications on iOS, the `remote-notification` value needs to be present in the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's Info.plist file.

If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation), set the [`enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications` property](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configurable-properties) of the config plugin to true, and the correct configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your Expo.plist file:

ios/project-name/Supporting/Expo.plist

Copy


    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>remote-notification</string>
    </array>


## Additional information

### Set custom notification sounds

To add custom push notification sounds to your app, add the `expo-notifications` plugin to your app.json file and then under the `sounds` key, provide an array of local paths to sound files that can be used as custom notification sounds. These local paths are local to your project.

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-notifications",
            {
              "sounds": ["local/path/to/mySoundFile.wav"]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


After building your app, the array of files will be available for use in both [`NotificationContentInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontentinput) and [`NotificationChannelInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationchannelinput). You only need to provide the base filename. Here's an example using the config above:


    await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
      name: 'E-mail notifications',
      importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
      sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
    });

    await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
      content: {
        title: "You've got mail! 📬",
        sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
      },
      trigger: {
        type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
        seconds: 2,
        channelId: 'new_emails',
      },
    });


You can also manually add notification files to your Android and iOS projects if you prefer:

Manually adding notification sounds on Android

On Androids 8.0+, playing a custom sound for a notification requires more than setting the `sound` property on the `NotificationContentInput`. You will also need to configure the `NotificationChannel` with the appropriate `sound`, and use it when sending/scheduling the notification.

For the example below to work, you would place your email_sound.wav file in android/app/src/main/res/raw/.


    // Prepare the notification channel
    await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
      name: 'E-mail notifications',
      importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
      sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android 8.0+, see channelId property below
    });

    // Eg. schedule the notification
    await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
      content: {
        title: "You've got mail! 📬",
        body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
        sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android below 8.0
      },
      trigger: {
        type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
        seconds: 2,
        channelId: 'new_emails', // <- for Android 8.0+, see definition above
      },
    });


Manually adding notification sounds on iOS

On iOS, all that's needed is to place your sound file in your Xcode project (see the screenshot below), and then specify the sound file in your `NotificationContentInput`, like this:


    await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
      content: {
        title: "You've got mail! 📬",
        body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
        sound: 'notification.wav',
      },
      trigger: {
        // ...
      },
    });


### Push notification payload specification

See [Message request format](/push-notifications/sending-notifications#message-request-format).

### Manage notification categories for interactive notifications

Notification categories allow you to create interactive push notifications, so that a user can respond directly to the incoming notification either via buttons or a text response. A category defines the set of actions a user can take, and then those actions are applied to a notification by specifying the `categoryIdentifier` in the [`NotificationContent`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontent).

On iOS, notification categories also allow you to customize your notifications further. With each category, not only can you set interactive actions a user can take, but you can also configure things like the placeholder text to display when the user disables notification previews for your app.

## Platform-specific guides

### Handling notification channels

Android 8+

Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel. Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all, as [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels) states.

If you do not specify a notification channel, `expo-notifications` will create a fallback channel for you, named Miscellaneous. We encourage you to always ensure appropriate channels with informative names are set up for the application and to always send notifications to these channels.

> Calling these methods is a no-op for platforms that do not support this feature (Android below version 8.0 (26) and iOS).

### Custom notification icon and colors

Android

You can configure the `icon` and `color` keys for notification in the project by using the [`expo-notifications` config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configurable-properties) with [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/continuous-native-generation). These are build-time settings, so you'll need to recompile your native Android app with `eas build -p android` or `npx expo run:android` to see the changes.

For your notification icon, make sure you follow [Google's design guidelines](https://m2.material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles) (the icon must be all white with a transparent background) or else it may not be displayed as intended.

You can also set a custom notification color per-notification directly in your [`NotificationContentInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontentinput) under the `color` attribute.

## API


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';


## Fetch tokens for push notifications

### `addPushTokenListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `[PushTokenListener](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#pushtokenlistenertoken)`| A function accepting a push token as an argument, it will be called whenever the push token changes.




In rare situations, a push token may be changed by the push notification service while the app is running. When a token is rolled, the old one becomes invalid and sending notifications to it will fail. A push token listener will let you handle this situation gracefully by registering the new token with your backend right away.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

An `EventSubscription` object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example


    import React from 'react';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    import { registerDevicePushTokenAsync } from '../api';

    export default function App() {
      React.useEffect(() => {
        const subscription = Notifications.addPushTokenListener(registerDevicePushTokenAsync);
        return () => subscription.remove();
      }, []);

      return (
        // Your app content
      );
    }


### `getDevicePushTokenAsync()`

Android

iOS

Returns a native FCM, APNs token or a [`PushSubscription` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) that can be used with another push notification service.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<DevicePushToken>`

### `getExpoPushTokenAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
options(optional)| `ExpoPushTokenOptions`| Object allowing you to pass in push notification configuration.Default:`{}`




Returns an Expo token that can be used to send a push notification to the device using Expo's push notifications service.

This method makes requests to the Expo's servers. It can get rejected in cases where the request itself fails (for example, due to the device being offline, experiencing a network timeout, or other HTTPS request failures). To provide offline support to your users, you should `try/catch` this method and implement retry logic to attempt to get the push token later, once the device is back online.

> For Expo's backend to be able to send notifications to your app, you will need to provide it with push notification keys. For more information, see [credentials](/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup#get-credentials-for-development-builds) in the push notifications setup.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<ExpoPushToken>`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object representing acquired push token.

Example


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    export async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(userId: string) {
      const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
       projectId: 'your-project-id',
      });

      await fetch('https://example.com/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          userId,
          expoPushToken,
        }),
      });
    }


## Listen to notification events

### `addNotificationReceivedListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `(event: Notification) => void`| A function accepting a notification (`Notification`) as an argument.




Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a notification is received while the app is running.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

An `EventSubscription` object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example


    import React from 'react';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    export default function App() {
      React.useEffect(() => {
        const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
          console.log(notification);
        });
        return () => subscription.remove();
      }, []);

      return (
        // Your app content
      );
    }


### `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `(event: NotificationResponse) => void`| A function accepting notification response (`NotificationResponse`) as an argument.




Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a user interacts with a notification (for example, taps on it).

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

An `EventSubscription` object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example


    import React from 'react';
    import { Linking } from 'react-native';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    export default function Container() {
      React.useEffect(() => {
        const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
          const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;
          Linking.openURL(url);
        });
        return () => subscription.remove();
      }, []);

      return (
        // Your app content
      );
    }


### `addNotificationsDroppedListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `() => void`| A callback function.




Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever some notifications have been dropped by the server. Applicable only to Firebase Cloud Messaging which we use as a notifications service on Android. It corresponds to `onDeletedMessages()` callback. More information can be found in [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#override-ondeletedmessages).

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

An `EventSubscription` object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

### `useLastNotificationResponse()`

Android

iOS

A React hook which returns the notification response that was received most recently (a notification response designates an interaction with a notification, such as tapping on it).

To clear the last notification response, use `clearLastNotificationResponseAsync()`.

> If you don't want to use a hook, you can use `Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync()` instead.

Returns:

`MaybeNotificationResponse`

The hook may return one of these three types/values:

  * `undefined` \- until we're sure of what to return,
  * `null` \- if no notification response has been received yet,
  * a `NotificationResponse` object - if a notification response was received.


Example

Responding to a notification tap by opening a URL that could be put into the notification's `data` (opening the URL is your responsibility and is not a part of the `expo-notifications` API):


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
    import { Linking } from 'react-native';

    export default function App() {
      const lastNotificationResponse = Notifications.useLastNotificationResponse();
      React.useEffect(() => {
        if (
          lastNotificationResponse &&
          lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url &&
          lastNotificationResponse.actionIdentifier === Notifications.DEFAULT_ACTION_IDENTIFIER
        ) {
          Linking.openURL(lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url);
        }
      }, [lastNotificationResponse]);
      return (
        // Your app content
      );
    }


## Present incoming notifications when the app is running

### `setNotificationHandler(handler)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
handler| `NotificationHandler | null`| A single parameter which should be either `null` (if you want to clear the handler) or a `NotificationHandler` object.




When a notification is received while the app is running, using this function you can set a callback that will decide whether the notification should be shown to the user or not.

When a notification is received, `handleNotification` is called with the incoming notification as an argument. The function should respond with a behavior object within 3 seconds, otherwise, the notification will be discarded. If the notification is handled successfully, `handleSuccess` is called with the identifier of the notification, otherwise (or on timeout) `handleError` will be called.

The default behavior when the handler is not set or does not respond in time is not to show the notification.

Returns:

`void`

Example


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
      handleNotification: async () => ({
        shouldShowBanner: true,
        shouldShowList: true,
        shouldPlaySound: false,
        shouldSetBadge: false,
      }),
    });


## Run JavaScript in response to incoming notifications

### `registerTaskAsync(taskName)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
taskName| `string`| The string you passed to `TaskManager.defineTask` as the `taskName` parameter.




Call `registerTaskAsync` to set a callback (task) that runs when a notification is received while the app is in foreground, background, or terminated. Only on Android, the task also runs in response to a notification action tap when the app is backgrounded or terminated. When the app is terminated, only a [Headless Background Notification](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#headless-background-notifications) triggers the task execution. However, the OS may decide not to deliver the notification to your app in some cases (e.g. when the device is in Doze mode on Android, or when you send too many notifications - Apple recommends to not ["send more than two or three per hour"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app#overview)).

Under the hood, this function is run using `expo-task-manager`. You must define the task first, with [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor) and register it with `registerTaskAsync`.

Make sure you define and register the task in the module scope of a JS module which is required early by your app (e.g. in the `index.ts` file) - see this [example](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/apps/notification-tester/index.ts#L2). `expo-task-manager` loads your app's JS bundle in the background and executes the task, as well as any side effects which may happen as a consequence of requiring any JS modules.

The callback function you define with `TaskManager.defineTask` receives an object with the following fields:

  * `data`: The remote payload delivered by either FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS). See `NotificationTaskPayload` for details.
  * `executionInfo`: JSON object of additional info related to the task, including the `taskName`.
  * `error`: This field should always be undefined with a push-notification task.


From the callback function, you may return a `BackgroundNotificationResult` value to indicate the result of a background fetch operation on iOS.

Be advised that console.log statements may not be appropriate for debugging background tasks, as the output may not be visible depending on the platform and app state.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<null>`

Example


    import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    const BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK = 'BACKGROUND-NOTIFICATION-TASK';

    TaskManager.defineTask<Notifications.NotificationTaskPayload>(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, ({ data, executionInfo, error }) => {
      console.log('Received a notification task payload!');
      const isNotificationResponse = 'actionIdentifier' in data;
      if (isNotificationResponse) {
        // Do something with the notification response from user
      } else {
        // Do something with the data from notification that was received
      }
      return BackgroundNotificationResult.NoData
    });

    Notifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);


### `unregisterTaskAsync(taskName)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
taskName| `string`| The string you passed to `registerTaskAsync` as the `taskName` parameter.




Used to unregister tasks registered with `registerTaskAsync` method.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<null>`

## Fetch information about notifications-related permissions

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`

It returns a `Promise` resolving to an object represents permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`). On iOS, make sure you properly interpret the permissions response.

Example


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    export async function allowsNotificationsAsync() {
      const settings = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
      return (
        settings.granted || settings.ios?.status === Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL
      );
    }


### `requestPermissionsAsync(permissions)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
permissions(optional)| `NotificationPermissionsRequest`| An object representing configuration for the request scope.




Prompts the user for notification permissions according to request. Request defaults to asking the user to allow displaying alerts, setting badge count and playing sounds.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`

It returns a Promise resolving to an object represents permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`). On iOS, make sure you properly interpret the permissions response.

Example


    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

    export function requestPermissionsAsync() {
      return Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync({
        ios: {
          allowAlert: true,
          allowBadge: true,
          allowSound: true,
        },
      });
    }


## Manage application badge icon

### `getBadgeCountAsync()`

Android

iOS

Fetches the number currently set as the badge of the app icon on device's home screen. A `0` value means that the badge is not displayed.

> Note: Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will always resolve to `0`.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`

Returns a Promise resolving to a number that represents the current badge of the app icon.

### `setBadgeCountAsync(badgeCount, options)`

priority(optional)| `string`| Only for: Android
Relative priority for this notification. Priority is an indication of how much of the user's valuable attention should be consumed by this notification. Low-priority notifications may be hidden from the user in certain situations, while the user might be interrupted for a higher-priority notification. The system will make a determination about how to interpret this priority when presenting the notification.
