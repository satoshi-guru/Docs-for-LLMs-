`expo-screen-capture` allows you to protect screens in your app from being captured or recorded, as well as be notified if a screenshot is taken while your app is foregrounded. The two most common reasons you may want to prevent screen capture are:

  * If a screen is displaying sensitive information (password, credit card data, and so on)
  * You are displaying paid content that you don't want to be recorded and shared


This is especially important on Android since the [`android.media.projection`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenCapture) API allows third-party apps to perform screen capture or screen sharing (even if the app is in the background).

On Android, the screen capture callback works without additional permissions only for Android 14+. You don't need to request or check permissions for blocking screen capture or using the callback on Android 14+.

If you want to use the screen capture callback on Android 13 or lower, you need to add the `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file. You can use the `android.permissions` key in your app config. See [Android permissions](/guides/permissions#android) for more information.

> The `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission can be added only for apps needing broad access to photos. See [Details on Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180).

> For testing screen capture functionality: On Android Emulator, run `adb shell input keyevent 120` in a separate terminal to trigger a screenshot. On iOS Simulator, you can trigger screenshots using Device > Trigger Screenshot from the menu bar.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-screen-capture`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Example: hook

Screen Capture hook

Copy

Open in Snack


    import { usePreventScreenCapture } from 'expo-screen-capture';

Callback for screen capture

Copy

Open in Snack


    import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture';
    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import { Button, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

    export default function useScreenCaptureCallback() {
      // Only use this if you add the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES permission to your AndroidManifest.xml
      const hasPermissions = async () => {
        const { status } = await ScreenCapture.requestPermissionsAsync();
        return status === 'granted';
      };

      useEffect(() => {
        let subscription;

        const addListenerAsync = async () => {
          if (await hasPermissions()) {
            subscription = ScreenCapture.addScreenshotListener(() => {
              alert('Thanks for screenshotting my beautiful app 😊');
            });
          } else {
            console.error('Permissions needed to subscribe to screenshot events are missing!');
          }
        };
        addListenerAsync();

        return () => {
          subscription?.remove();
        };
      }, []);
    }


## API


    import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture';


## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request permissions necessary for detecting when a screenshot is taken. This uses both `requestPermissionsAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = ScreenCapture.usePermissions();


### `usePreventScreenCapture(key)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key(optional)| `string`| If provided, this will prevent multiple instances of this hook or the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods from conflicting with each other. This argument is useful if you have multiple active components using the `allowScreenCaptureAsync` hook.Default:`'default'`




A React hook to prevent screen capturing for as long as the owner component is mounted.

Returns:

`void`

### `useScreenshotListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `() => void`| A function that will be called whenever a screenshot is detected. This hook automatically starts listening when the component mounts, and stops listening when the component unmounts.




A React hook that listens for screenshots taken while the component is mounted.

Returns:

`void`

## Methods

### `ScreenCapture.allowScreenCaptureAsync(key)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key(optional)| `string`| This will prevent multiple instances of the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods from conflicting with each other. If provided, the value must be the same as the key passed to `preventScreenCaptureAsync` in order to re-enable screen capturing.Default:`'default'`




Re-allows the user to screen record or screenshot your app. If you haven't called `preventScreenCapture()` yet, this method does nothing.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.disableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync()`

iOS

Disables the privacy protection overlay that was previously enabled with `enableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync`.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.enableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync(blurIntensity)`

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
blurIntensity(optional)| `number`| The intensity of the blur effect, from 0.0 (no blur) to 1.0 (maximum blur). Default is 0.5.Default:`0.5`




Enables a privacy protection blur overlay that hides sensitive content when the app is not in focus. The overlay applies a customizable blur effect when the app is in the app switcher, background, or during interruptions (calls, Siri, Control Center, etc.), and automatically removes it when the app becomes active again.

This provides visual privacy protection by preventing sensitive app content from being visible in:

  * App switcher previews
  * Background app snapshots
  * Screenshots taken during inactive states


For Android, app switcher protection is automatically provided by `preventScreenCaptureAsync()` using the FLAG_SECURE window flag, which shows a blank screen in the recent apps preview.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.getPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Checks user's permissions for detecting when a screenshot is taken.

> Only Android requires additional permissions to detect screenshots. On iOS devices, this method will always resolve to a `granted` permission response.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object.

### `ScreenCapture.isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

Returns whether the Screen Capture API is available on the current device.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` indicating whether the Screen Capture API is available on the current device.

### `ScreenCapture.preventScreenCaptureAsync(key)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key(optional)| `string`| Optional. If provided, this will help prevent multiple instances of the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods (and `usePreventScreenCapture` hook) from conflicting with each other. When using multiple keys, you'll have to re-allow each one in order to re-enable screen capturing.Default:`'default'`




Prevents screenshots and screen recordings until `allowScreenCaptureAsync` is called or the app is restarted. If you are already preventing screen capture, this method does nothing (unless you pass a new and unique `key`).

> On iOS, this prevents screen recordings and screenshots, and is only available on iOS 11+ (recordings) and iOS 13+ (screenshots). On older iOS versions, this method does nothing.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

Asks the user to grant permissions necessary for detecting when a screenshot is taken.

> Only Android requires additional permissions to detect screenshots. On iOS devices, this method will always resolve to a `granted` permission response.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

A promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object.

## Event Subscriptions

### `ScreenCapture.addScreenshotListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `() => void`| The function that will be executed when the user takes a screenshot. This function accepts no arguments.




Adds a listener that will fire whenever the user takes a screenshot while the app is foregrounded.

Permission requirements for this method depend on your device’s Android version:

  * Before Android 13: Requires `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.
  * Android 13: Switches to `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`.
  * Post-Android 13: No additional permissions required. You can request the appropriate permissions by using [`MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library#medialibraryrequestpermissionsasync).


Returns:

`EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object that you can use to unregister the listener, either by calling `remove()` or passing it to `removeScreenshotListener`.

> Deprecated: use subscription.remove() instead.

### `ScreenCapture.removeScreenshotListener(subscription)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
subscription| `EventSubscription`




Removes the subscription you provide, so that you are no longer listening for screenshots.

Returns:

`void`

### `ScreenCapture.useScreenshotListener(listener)`

Android

iOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
listener| `() => void`| A function that will be called whenever a screenshot is detected. This hook automatically starts listening when the component mounts, and stops listening when the component unmounts.
