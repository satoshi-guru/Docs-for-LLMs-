`expo-secure-store` provides a way to encrypt and securely store key-value pairs locally on the device. Each Expo project has a separate storage system and has no access to the storage of other Expo projects.

Large payloads can be rejected by the underlying platform. Historically, some iOS releases refused values above roughly 2048 bytes. Expo does not enforce a limit, so make sure to handle native errors if you plan to store very large strings.

The `requireAuthentication` option is not supported in Expo Go when biometric authentication is available due to a missing `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key.

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-secure-store`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-secure-store` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-secure-store",
            {
              "configureAndroidBackup": true,
              "faceIDPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data."
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`configureAndroidBackup`| `true`| Only for: Android
A boolean indicating whether to configure automatic Android backup to work correctly with `expo-secure-store`. Learn more.
`faceIDPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data."`| Only for: iOS
A string to set the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` permission message.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Add `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key to Info.plist:

Info.plist

Copy


    <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data.</string>


## Platform value storage

### Android

On Android, values are stored in [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences), encrypted with [Android's Keystore system](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html).

### iOS

On iOS, values are stored using the [keychain services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) as `kSecClassGenericPassword`. Due to the underlying nature of iOS Keychain, data stored with `expo-secure-store` will persist across app uninstallations when the app is reinstalled with the same bundle ID. This is an expected behavior of the iOS Keychain system and should be considered when designing your app's data handling. iOS has the additional option of being able to set the value's `kSecAttrAccessible` attribute, which controls when the value is available to be fetched.

## Data persistence

`expo-secure-store` is designed to provide a persistent data storage solution across app restarts and updates. However, it is important not to rely on it as a single source of truth for irreplaceable, critical data.

  * On Android: Data saved using `expo-secure-store` will not be preserved upon app uninstallation.
  * On iOS: Data saved using `expo-secure-store` will persist across app uninstallations if the app is reinstalled with the same bundle ID. This is due to how the iOS Keychain manages stored credentials. Keep in mind that this is not guaranteed and you should never rely on this implementation detail.


Additionally, any data protected with the `requireAuthentication` option set to `true` will become inaccessible if there are changes to the user's biometric settings, such as adding a new fingerprint.

#### Exempting encryption prompt

Apple App Store Connect prompts you to select the type of encryption algorithm your app implements. This is known as Export Compliance Information. It is asked when publishing the app or submitting for TestFlight.

When using `expo-secure-store`, you can set the [`ios.config.usesNonExemptEncryption`](/versions/latest/config/app#usesnonexemptencryption) property to `false` in the app config:

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "ios": {
          "config": {
            "usesNonExemptEncryption": false
          }
          %%placeholder-start%%... %%placeholder-end%%
        }
      }
    }


Setting this property automatically handles the compliance information prompt.

## Android Auto Backup

[Android Auto Backup for Apps](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup) automatically backs up a user's data from apps that target and run on Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

The Auto Backup system has to be configured to exclude `expo-secure-store` shared preferences entries, as it's impossible to decrypt them after restoring the backup — app's entries are deleted from the Android Key Store when the app is uninstalled.

If your app doesn't have any custom backup configuration, `expo-secure-store` will automatically configure the Auto Backup system to ignore the `expo-secure-store` data.

If you are using your own Auto Backup configuration, you should exclude the `SecureStore` under the `sharedpref` domain and set the `configureAndroidBackup` to `false` in the [config plugin configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/securestore#example-appjson-with-config-plugin).


    <!--  Auto Backup configuration for Android 12 and higher -->
    <data-extraction-rules>
      <cloud-backup>
        <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="SecureStore"/>

      <device-transfer>
        <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="SecureStore"/>

## API


    import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';


## Constants

### `SecureStore.AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

The data in the keychain item cannot be accessed after a restart until the device has been unlocked once by the user. This may be useful if you need to access the item when the phone is locked.

### `SecureStore.AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Similar to `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

> Deprecated: Use an accessibility level that provides some user protection, such as `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`.

### `SecureStore.ALWAYS`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

The data in the keychain item can always be accessed regardless of whether the device is locked. This is the least secure option.

> Deprecated: Use an accessibility level that provides some user protection, such as `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`.

### `SecureStore.ALWAYS_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Similar to `ALWAYS`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_PASSCODE_SET_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Similar to `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`, except the user must have set a passcode in order to store an entry. If the user removes their passcode, the entry will be deleted.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

The data in the keychain item can be accessed only while the device is unlocked by the user.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Similar to `WHEN_UNLOCKED`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

## Methods

### `SecureStore.canUseBiometricAuthentication()`

Android

iOS

Checks if the value can be saved with `requireAuthentication` option enabled.

Returns:

`boolean`

`true` if the device supports biometric authentication and the enrolled method is sufficiently secure. Otherwise, returns `false`. Always returns false on tvOS.

### `SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key, options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key| `string`| The key that was used to store the associated value.
options(optional)| `SecureStoreOptions`| An `SecureStoreOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Delete the value associated with the provided key.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise that rejects if the value can't be deleted.

### `SecureStore.getItem(key, options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key| `string`| The key that was used to store the associated value.
options(optional)| `SecureStoreOptions`| An `SecureStoreOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Synchronously reads the stored value associated with the provided key.

> Note: This function blocks the JavaScript thread, so the application may not be interactive when reading a value with `requireAuthentication` option set to `true` until the user authenticates.

Returns:

`string | null`

Previously stored value. It resolves with `null` if there is no entry for the given key or if the key has been invalidated.

### `SecureStore.getItemAsync(key, options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key| `string`| The key that was used to store the associated value.
options(optional)| `SecureStoreOptions`| An `SecureStoreOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Reads the stored value associated with the provided key.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null>`

A promise that resolves to the previously stored value. It resolves with `null` if there is no entry for the given key or if the key has been invalidated. It rejects if an error occurs while retrieving the value.

> Keys are invalidated by the system when biometrics change, such as adding a new fingerprint or changing the face profile used for face recognition. After a key has been invalidated, it becomes impossible to read its value. This only applies to values stored with `requireAuthentication` set to `true`.

### `SecureStore.isAvailableAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Returns whether the SecureStore API is enabled on the current device. This does not check the app permissions.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Promise which fulfils with a `boolean`, indicating whether the SecureStore API is available on the current device. Currently, this resolves `true` on Android and iOS only.

### `SecureStore.setItem(key, value, options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key| `string`| The key to associate with the stored value. Keys may contain alphanumeric characters, `.`, `-`, and `_`.
value| `string`| The value to store.
options(optional)| `SecureStoreOptions`| An `SecureStoreOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Stores a key–value pair synchronously.

> Note: This function blocks the JavaScript thread, so the application may not be interactive when the `requireAuthentication` option is set to `true` until the user authenticates.

Returns:

`void`

### `SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value, options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
key| `string`| The key to associate with the stored value. Keys may contain alphanumeric characters, `.`, `-`, and `_`.
value| `string`| The value to store.
options(optional)| `SecureStoreOptions`| An `SecureStoreOptions` object.Default:`{}`




Stores a key–value pair.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise that rejects if value cannot be stored on the device.

## Types

### `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `number`

### `SecureStoreOptions`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
accessGroup(optional)| `string`| Only for: iOS
Specifies the access group the stored entry belongs to.

> See: Apple's documentation on [Sharing access to keychain items among a collection of apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/sharing-access-to-keychain-items-among-a-collection-of-apps).

authenticationPrompt(optional)| `string`| Custom message displayed to the user while `requireAuthentication` option is turned on.
keychainAccessible(optional)| `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`| Only for: iOS
Specifies when the stored entry is accessible, using iOS's `kSecAttrAccessible` property.Default:`SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED`

> See: Apple's documentation on [keychain item accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccessible/).

keychainService(optional)| `string`|

  * Android: Equivalent of the public/private key pair `Alias`.
  * iOS: The item's service, equivalent to [`kSecAttrService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattrservice/).


> If the item is set with the `keychainService` option, it will be required to later fetch the value.

requireAuthentication(optional)| `boolean`| Option responsible for enabling the usage of the user authentication methods available on the device while accessing data stored in SecureStore.

  * Android: Equivalent to [`setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder#setUserAuthenticationRequired\(boolean\)) (requires API 23).
  * iOS: Equivalent to [`biometryCurrentSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrolcreateflags/2937192-biometrycurrentset). Complete functionality is unlocked only with a freshly generated key - this would not work in tandem with the `keychainService` value used for the others non-authenticated operations.

This option works slightly differently across platforms: On Android, user authentication is required for all operations. On iOS, the user is prompted to authenticate only when reading or updating an existing value (not when creating a new one). Warning: This option is not supported in Expo Go when biometric authentication is available due to a missing NSFaceIDUsageDescription. In release builds or when using continuous native generation, make sure to use the `expo-secure-store` config plugin.

> Note: This library requires a real device for testing since emulators/simulators do not require biometric authentication when retrieving secrets, unlike real iOS devices.
