A library for tracking app users and managing tracking permissions. Provides access to advertising identifiers and manages the required permissions for tracking. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and more. If the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" device-level setting is off, this permission will be denied. Be sure to add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` to your [Info.plist](/versions/latest/config/app#infoplist) to explain how the user will be tracked. Otherwise, your app will be rejected by Apple.

For more information on Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, see their [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-tracking-transparency`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-tracking-transparency` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does not use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy


    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-tracking-transparency",
            {
              "userTrackingPermission": "This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you."
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }


### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description
---|---|---
`userTrackingPermission`| `"Allow this app to collect app-related data that can be used for tracking you or your device."`| Only for: iOS
Sets the iOS `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` permission message in Info.plist.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native android and ios projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

  * For Android, add `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` permission to your project's android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.

        <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"/>


  * For iOS, add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key to your project's ios/[app]/Info.plist:

        <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Your custom usage description string here.</string>



## Usage

Basic tracking transparency usage

Copy

Open in Snack


    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import { Text, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
    import { requestTrackingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-tracking-transparency';

    export default function App() {
      useEffect(() => {
        (async () => {
          const { status } = await requestTrackingPermissionsAsync();
          if (status === 'granted') {
            console.log('Yay! I have user permission to track data');
          }
        })();
      }, []);

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text>Tracking Transparency Module Example</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    });


## API


    import * as ExpoTrackingTransparency from 'expo-tracking-transparency';


## Hooks

### `useTrackingPermissions(options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions<object>`




Check or request the user to authorize or deny access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and so on. On iOS, if the user denies this permission, any attempt to collect the IDFA will return a string of 0s.

The system remembers the user’s choice and doesn’t prompt again unless a user uninstalls and then reinstalls the app on the device.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns:

`[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse>]`

Example


    const [status, requestPermission] = useTrackingPermissions();


## Methods

### `getAdvertisingId()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Gets the advertising ID, a UUID string intended only for advertising. Use this string for frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging.

As a best practice, don't store the advertising ID. Instead, call this function each time your app needs to use the advertising ID. Users can change whether they allow app tracking and can reset their advertising ID at any time in their system settings. Check your app's authorization using `getTrackingPermissionsAsync()` to determine the user's intent.

On Android, this function returns the "Android Advertising ID" ([AAID](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid)). On Android devices that support multiple users, including guest users, it's possible for your app to obtain different advertising IDs on the same device. These different IDs correspond to different users who could be signed in on that device. See Google's documentation for more information: [Get a user-resettable advertising ID](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/ad-id).

On iOS, this function returns the "Identifier for Advertisers" ([IDFA](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/advertisingidentifier)), a string that's unique to each device. Your app must request tracking authorization using `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()` before it can get the advertising identifier.

Returns:

`string | null`

Returns either a UUID `string` or `null`. It returns null in the following cases:

  * On Android, when `isLimitAdTrackingEnabled()` is `true`
  * In the iOS simulator, regardless of any settings
  * On iOS if you haven't received permission using `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`
  * On iOS, if you've requested permission and the user declines
  * On iOS, when a profile or configuration restricts access to the advertising identifier, such as when the user has turned off the system-wide "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting


Example


    TrackingTransparency.getAdvertisingId();
    // "E9228286-4C4E-4789-9D95-15827DCB291B"


### `getTrackingPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Checks whether or not the user has authorized the app to access app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. See `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync` for more details.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

Example


    const { granted } = await getTrackingPermissionsAsync();

    if (granted) {
      // Your app is authorized to track the user or their device
    }


### `isAvailable()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Returns whether the TrackingTransparency API is available on the current device.

Returns:

`boolean`

On devices where the Tracking Transparency API is unavailable, the get and request permissions methods will always resolve to `granted`.

### `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Requests the user to authorize or deny access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and so on. On iOS, if the user denies this permission, any attempt to collect the IDFA will return a string of 0s.

The system remembers the user’s choice and doesn’t prompt again unless a user uninstalls and then reinstalls the app on the device.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse>`

Example


    const { granted } = await requestTrackingPermissionsAsync();

    if (granted) {
      // Your app is authorized to track the user or their device
    }


## Types
