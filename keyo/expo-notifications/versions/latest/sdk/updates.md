`expo-updates` is a library that enables your app to manage remote updates to your application code. It communicates with the configured remote update service to get information about available updates.

## Installation

The `expo-updates` library can be automatically configured using [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction), which is a hosted service that manages and serves updates to your app. To get started with EAS Update, follow the instructions in the [Get started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.

Alternatively, it is also possible to configure the `expo-updates` library manually in cases where a different remote update service is required or configuration is only specified in native files.

Manual installation, configuration, and custom remote update services

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-updates`

If you're installing this library in a [bare React Native app](/bare/overview) or a generic app with manually configured native code, follow these [installation instructions](/bare/installing-updates).

If using [app config](/workflow/configuration) for configuration, this library can be configured by setting at least the following app config properties:

  * [`updates.url`](/versions/latest/config/app#updates): a URL of a remote service implementing the [Expo Updates protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1)
  * [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion): a [runtime version](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#runtime-version)


The remote service must implement the [Expo Updates protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1). [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction) is one such service, but it is also possible to use this library with a custom server.

[Custom Expo Updates ServerExample implementation of a custom server and an app using that server.](https://github.com/expo/custom-expo-updates-server)

## Configuration

There are build-time configuration options that control the behavior of the library. For most apps, these configuration values are set in the [app config](/workflow/configuration) under the [`updates` property](/versions/latest/config/app#updates).

[App config property](/versions/latest/config/app#updates)| Default| Required?| iOS plist/dictionary key| Android meta-data name| Android Map key
---|---|---|---|---|---
[`updates.enabled`](/versions/latest/config/app#enabled)| `true`| | `EXUpdatesEnabled`| `expo.modules.updates.ENABLED`| `enabled`
[`updates.url`](/versions/latest/config/app#url)| (none)| | `EXUpdatesURL`| `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATE_URL`| `updateUrl`
[`updates.requestHeaders`](/versions/latest/config/app#requestheaders)| (none)| | `EXUpdatesRequestHeaders`| `expo.modules.updates.UPDATES_CONFIGURATION_REQUEST_HEADERS_KEY`| `requestHeaders`
[`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion)| (none)| | `EXUpdatesRuntimeVersion`| `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_RUNTIME_VERSION`| `runtimeVersion`
[`updates.checkAutomatically`](/versions/latest/config/app#checkautomatically)| `ON_LOAD`| | `EXUpdatesCheckOnLaunch`| `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATES_CHECK_ON_LAUNCH`| `checkOnLaunch`
[`updates.fallbackToCacheTimeout`](/versions/latest/config/app#fallbacktocachetimeout)| `0`| | `EXUpdatesLaunchWaitMs`| `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATES_LAUNCH_WAIT_MS`| `launchWaitMs`
[`updates.useEmbeddedUpdate`](/versions/latest/config/app#useembeddedupdate)| `true`| | `EXUpdatesHasEmbeddedUpdate`| `expo.modules.updates.HAS_EMBEDDED_UPDATE`| `hasEmbeddedUpdate`
[`updates.codeSigningCertificate`](/versions/latest/config/app#codesigningcertificate)| (none)| | `EXUpdatesCodeSigningCertificate`| `expo.modules.updates.CODE_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE`| `codeSigningCertificate`
[`updates.codeSigningMetadata`](/versions/latest/config/app#codesigningmetadata)| (none)| | `EXUpdatesCodeSigningMetadata`| `expo.modules.updates.CODE_SIGNING_METADATA`| `codeSigningMetadata`
[`updates.assetPatternsToBeBundled`](/versions/latest/config/app#assetpatternstobebundled)| (none)| | N/A| N/A| N/A
[`updates.disableAntiBrickingMeasures`](/versions/latest/config/app#disableantibrickingmeasures)| `false`| | `EXUpdatesDisableAntiBrickingMeasures`| `expo.modules.updates.DISABLE_ANTI_BRICKING_MEASURES`| `disableAntiBrickingMeasures`
[`updates.enableBsdiffPatchSupport`](/versions/latest/config/app#enablebsdiffpatchsupport)| `true`| | `EXUpdatesEnableBsdiffPatchSupport`| `expo.modules.updates.ENABLE_BSDIFF_PATCH_SUPPORT`| `enableBsdiffPatchSupport`

The two core required configuration options are:

  * [`updates.url`](/versions/latest/config/app#updates): the URL at which the library fetches remote updates
  * [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion): a [runtime version](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#runtime-version)


These are configured automatically when following the EAS Update [Get started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.

#### Runtime version

Each time you build a binary for your app it includes the native code and configuration present at the time of the build as well as native configuration, and this unique combination is represented by a string called a runtime version. A remote update targets one runtime version, indicating that only binaries with a matching runtime version can load the remote update.

Manual configuration

The runtime version can be managed manually by setting the string value in the config field.


    {
      "expo": {
        "runtimeVersion": "<runtime_version_string>"
      }
    }


Automatic configuration using runtime version policies

Runtime version policies derive the runtime version from another piece of information already present in your project. They can be set in the [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion) config field as follows:


    {
      "expo": {
        "runtimeVersion": {
          "policy": "<policy_name>"
        }
      }
    }


Available policy types:

appVersion

The `"appVersion"` policy is provided for projects with that wish to define their runtime compatibility based on the app version.

For example, in a project that has the following in its app config:


    {
      "expo": {
        "runtimeVersion": {
          "policy": "appVersion"
        },
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "ios": {
          "buildNumber": "1"
        },
        "android": {
          "versionCode": 1
        }
      }
    }


The `"appVersion"` policy will set the runtime version to the project's current `"version"` property. In this case, the runtime version for the Android and iOS builds and any updates would be `"1.0.0"`.

This policy is great for projects that contain custom native code and that update the `"version"` field after every public release. To submit an app, the app stores require an updated native version number for each submitted build, which makes this policy convenient if you want to be sure that every version installed on user devices has a different runtime version.

When using this policy, you need to manually update `"version"` field in the app config every time there is a public release, but for Play Store's Internal Test Track and the App Store's TestFlight uploads, you can rely on `"autoIncrement"` option in eas.json to [manage versions for you](/build-reference/app-versions#remote-version-source).

nativeVersion

The `"nativeVersion"` policy is provided for projects that wish to define their runtime compatibility based on the project's current `"version"` and `"versionCode"` (Android) or `"buildNumber"` (iOS) properties.

For example, in a project that has the following in its app config:


    {
      "expo": {
        "runtimeVersion": {
          "policy": "nativeVersion"
        },
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "ios": {
          "buildNumber": "1"
        },
        "android": {
          "versionCode": 1
        }
      }
    }


The runtime version for the Android and iOS builds and any updates would be the combination of `"[version]([buildNumber|versionCode])"`, which in this case would be `"1.0.0(1)"`.

This policy is great for projects containing custom native code that update the native version numbers (`"buildNumber"` for iOS and `"versionCode"` for Android) for each build. To submit an app, the app stores require an updated native version number for each submitted build, which makes this policy convenient if you want to be sure that every app uploaded to the Play Store's Internal Test Track and the App Store's TestFlight distribution tools has a different `runtimeVersion`.

It's important to know that this policy requires management of the native version numbers manually between each build.

Also, if you select a different native version between Android and iOS, you'll end up with builds and updates with separate runtime versions.

fingerprint

The `"fingerprint"` runtime version policy automatically calculates the runtime version for you, including through changes like SDK upgrades or adding custom native code.


    {
      "expo": {
        "runtimeVersion": {
          "policy": "fingerprint"
        }
      }
    }


This policy works for both projects with and without custom native code. It works by using the [`@expo/fingerprint`](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint) package to calculate the hash of your project during builds and updates to determine build-update compatibility (also known as the runtime).

#### Native configuration and overriding

If your project does not use Continuous Native Generation, these configuration values may also be set in your app's native configuration files or overridden during initialization in native code.

Native configuration instructions

On Android, these options are set as `meta-data` tags in the AndroidManifest.xml file (adjacent to the tags added during installation if auto-setup was used). You can also set or override them at runtime using `UpdatesController.overrideConfiguration()`.

On iOS, these properties are set as keys in the Expo.plist file. You can also set or override them at runtime by calling `AppController.overrideConfiguration`.

Importing Swift generated headers for use in Objective-C++

If your iOS native code or `AppDelegate.mm` is written in Objective-C++, you will need to add the following imports to reference methods on `EXUpdatesAppController`. This is only necessary for overriding configuration at runtime.


    #import "ExpoModulesCore-Swift.h"
    #import "EXUpdatesInterface-Swift.h"
    #import "EXUpdates-Swift.h"


## Usage

By default, `expo-updates` checks for updates when the app launches. If an update is available, it downloads the update and applies it the next time the app is restarted. You can tune this startup behavior using the `checkAutomatically` and `fallbackToCacheTimeout` configuration options above.

The library also provides a variety of constants to inspect the current update and functions to customize update behavior from your application code (after startup). For example, one common alternative usage pattern is to manually check for updates after the app has started instead of doing the default check on launch.

Example: Check for updates manually

You can configure your app to check for updates manually by doing the following steps:

  1. Set the `checkAutomatically` configuration value to `ON_ERROR_RECOVERY` or `NEVER` to disable the library's default launch behavior.

  2. Add the following code to check for available updates, download them, and reload:

App.js

Copy

         import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
         import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';

         function App() {
           async function onFetchUpdateAsync() {
             try {
               const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync();

               if (update.isAvailable) {
                 await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync();
                 await Updates.reloadAsync();
               }
             } catch (error) {
               // You can also add an alert() to see the error message in case of an error when fetching updates.
               alert(`Error fetching latest Expo update: ${error}`);
             }
           }

           return (
             <View>
               <Button title="Fetch update" onPress={onFetchUpdateAsync} />
             </View>
           );
         }



## Testing

Most of the methods and constants in this library can be used or tested only in release builds. In debug builds, the default behavior is to always load the latest JavaScript from a development server. It is possible to [build a debug version of your app with the same updates behavior as a release build](/eas-update/debug#debugging-of-native-code-while-loading-the-app-through-expo-updates). Such an app will not open the latest JavaScript from your development server — it will load published updates just as a release build does. This may be useful for debugging the behavior of your app when it is not connected to a development server.

To test the content of an update in a development build, run [`eas update`](/eas-update/getting-started) and then browse to the update in your development build. Note that this only simulates what an update will look like in your app, and most of the [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is unavailable when running in a development build.

To test updates in a release build, you can create a [.apk](/build-reference/apk) or a [simulator build](/build-reference/simulators), or make a release build locally with `npx expo run:android --variant release` and `npx expo run:ios --configuration Release` (you don't need to submit this build to the store to test). The full [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is available in a release build.

To test the content of an update in Expo Go, run [`eas update`](/eas-update/getting-started) and then browse to the update in Expo Go. Note that this only simulates what an update will look like in your app, and most of the [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is unavailable when running in Expo Go. Also note that only updates using [Expo Go-compatible libraries](/workflow/using-libraries#determining-third-party-library-compatibility) are supported.

## API


    import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';


## Constants

### `Updates.channel`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `string | null`

The channel name of the current build, if configured for use with EAS Update. `null` otherwise.

Expo Go and development builds are not set to a specific channel and can run any updates compatible with their native runtime. Therefore, this value will always be `null` when running an update on Expo Go or a development build.

### `Updates.checkAutomatically`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `UpdatesCheckAutomaticallyValue | null`

Determines if and when `expo-updates` checks for and downloads updates automatically on startup.

### `Updates.createdAt`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `[Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | null`

If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is a `Date` object representing the creation time of the update that's currently running (whether it was embedded or downloaded at runtime).

In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this value is null.

### `Updates.emergencyLaunchReason`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `string | null`

If `isEmergencyLaunch` is set to true, this will contain a string error message describing what failed during initialization.

### `Updates.isEmbeddedLaunch`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `boolean`

This will be true if the currently running update is the one embedded in the build, and not one downloaded from the updates server.

### `Updates.isEmergencyLaunch`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `boolean`

`expo-updates` does its very best to always launch monotonically newer versions of your app so you don't need to worry about backwards compatibility when you put out an update. In very rare cases, it's possible that `expo-updates` may need to fall back to the update that's embedded in the app binary, even after newer updates have been downloaded and run (an "emergency launch"). This boolean will be `true` if the app is launching under this fallback mechanism and `false` otherwise. If you are concerned about backwards compatibility of future updates to your app, you can use this constant to provide special behavior for this rare case.

### `Updates.isEnabled`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `boolean`

Whether `expo-updates` is enabled. This may be false in a variety of cases including:

  * enabled set to false in configuration
  * missing or invalid URL in configuration
  * missing runtime version or SDK version in configuration
  * error accessing storage on device during initialization


When false, the embedded update is loaded.

### `Updates.latestContext`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `UpdatesNativeStateMachineContext`

### `Updates.launchDuration`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `number | null`

Number of milliseconds it took to launch.

### `Updates.manifest`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `[Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype)<Manifest>`

If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is the [manifest](/versions/latest/sdk/constants#manifest) (or [classic manifest](/versions/latest/sdk/constants#appmanifest)) object for the update that's currently running.

In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this object is empty.

### `Updates.runtimeVersion`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `string | null`

The runtime version of the current build.

### `Updates.updateId`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Type: `string | null`

The UUID that uniquely identifies the currently running update. The UUID is represented in its canonical string form and will always use lowercase letters. This value is `null` when running in a local development environment or any other environment where `expo-updates` is disabled.

Example

`"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`

## Hooks

### `useUpdates()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Hook that obtains information on available updates and on the currently running update.

Returns:

`UseUpdatesReturnType`

Example

UpdatesDemo.tsx

Copy


    import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
    import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
    import { useEffect } from 'react';

    export default function UpdatesDemo() {
      const {
        currentlyRunning,
        isUpdateAvailable,
        isUpdatePending
      } = Updates.useUpdates();

      useEffect(() => {
        if (isUpdatePending) {
          // Update has successfully downloaded; apply it now
          Updates.reloadAsync();
        }
      }, [isUpdatePending]);

      // If true, we show the button to download and run the update
      const showDownloadButton = isUpdateAvailable;

      // Show whether or not we are running embedded code or an update
      const runTypeMessage = currentlyRunning.isEmbeddedLaunch
        ? 'This app is running from built-in code'
        : 'This app is running an update';

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.headerText}>Updates Demo</Text>
          <Text>{runTypeMessage}</Text>
          <Button onPress={() => Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()} title="Check manually for updates" />

## Methods

### `Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Checks the server to see if a newly deployed update to your project is available. Does not actually download the update. This method cannot be used in development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so.

Checking for an update uses a device's bandwidth and battery life like any network call. Additionally, updates served by Expo may be rate limited. A good rule of thumb to check for updates judiciously is to check when the user launches or foregrounds the app. Avoid polling for updates in a frequent loop.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<UpdateCheckResult>`

A promise that fulfills with an `UpdateCheckResult` object.

The promise rejects in Expo Go or if the app is in development mode, or if there is an unexpected error or timeout communicating with the server. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

### `Updates.clearLogEntriesAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Clears existing `expo-updates` log entries.

> For now, this operation does nothing on the client. Once log persistence has been implemented, this operation will actually remove existing logs.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise that fulfills if the clear operation was successful.

The promise rejects if there is an unexpected error in clearing the logs.

### `Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Downloads the most recently deployed update to your project from server to the device's local storage. This method cannot be used in development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so.

> Note: `reloadAsync()` can be called after promise resolution to reload the app using the most recently downloaded version. Otherwise, the update will be applied on the next app cold start.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<UpdateFetchResult>`

A promise that fulfills with an `UpdateFetchResult` object.

The promise rejects in Expo Go or if the app is in development mode, or if there is an unexpected error or timeout communicating with the server. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

### `Updates.getExtraParamsAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Retrieves the current extra params.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<Record<string, string>>`

### `Updates.readLogEntriesAsync(maxAge)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type| Description
---|---|---
maxAge(optional)| `number`| Sets the max age of retrieved log entries in milliseconds. Default to `3600000` ms (1 hour).Default:`3600000`




Retrieves the most recent `expo-updates` log entries.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<UpdatesLogEntry[]>`

A promise that fulfills with an array of `UpdatesLogEntry` objects;

The promise rejects if there is an unexpected error in retrieving the logs.

### `Updates.reloadAsync(options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
options(optional)| `{  reloadScreenOptions: ReloadScreenOptions }`




Instructs the app to reload using the most recently downloaded version. This is useful for triggering a newly downloaded update to launch without the user needing to manually restart the app. Unlike `Expo.reloadAppAsync()` provided by the `expo` package, this function not only reloads the app but also changes the loaded JavaScript bundle to that of the most recently downloaded update.

It is not recommended to place any meaningful logic after a call to `await Updates.reloadAsync()`. This is because the promise is resolved after verifying that the app can be reloaded, and immediately before posting an asynchronous task to the main thread to actually reload the app. It is unsafe to make any assumptions about whether any more JS code will be executed after the `Updates.reloadAsync` method call resolves, since that depends on the OS and the state of the native module and main threads.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

A promise that fulfills right before the reload instruction is sent to the JS runtime, or rejects if it cannot find a reference to the JS runtime. If the promise is rejected in production mode, it most likely means you have installed the module incorrectly. Double check you've followed the installation instructions. In particular, on iOS ensure that you set the `bridge` property on `EXUpdatesAppController` with a pointer to the `RCTBridge` you want to reload, and on Android ensure you either call `UpdatesController.initialize` with the instance of `ReactApplication` you want to reload, or call `UpdatesController.setReactNativeHost` with the proper instance of `ReactNativeHost`.

### `Updates.setExtraParamAsync(key, value)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
key| `string`
value| `string | null | undefined`




Sets an extra param if value is non-null, otherwise unsets the param. Extra params are sent as an [Expo Structured Field Value Dictionary](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) in the `Expo-Extra-Params` header of update requests. A compliant update server may use these params when selecting an update to serve.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `Updates.setUpdateRequestHeadersOverride(requestHeaders)`

Experimental

•

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
requestHeaders| `Record<string, string> | null`




Overrides updates request headers in runtime from build time. This method allows you to load specific updates with custom request headers. Use this method at your own risk, as it may cause unexpected behavior. [Learn more about use cases and limitations](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/).

Returns:

`void`

### `Updates.setUpdateURLAndRequestHeadersOverride(configOverride)`

Experimental

•

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type
---|---
configOverride| `{  requestHeaders: Record<string, string>,  updateUrl: string } | null`




Overrides updates URL and reuqest headers in runtime from build time. This method allows you to load specific updates from a URL that you provide. Use this method at your own risk, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Because of the risk, this method requires `disableAntiBrickingMeasures` to be set to `true` in the app.json file. [Learn more about use cases and limitations](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/).

Returns:

`void`

## Types

### `CurrentlyRunningInfo`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Structure encapsulating information on the currently running app (either the embedded bundle or a downloaded update).

Property| Type| Description
---|---|---
channel(optional)| `string`| The channel name of the current build, if configured for use with EAS Update, `undefined` otherwise.
createdAt(optional)| `[Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)`| If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is a `Date` object representing the creation time of the update that's currently running (whether it was embedded or downloaded at runtime). In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this value is undefined.
emergencyLaunchReason| `string | null`| If `isEmergencyLaunch` is set to true, this will contain a string error message describing what failed during initialization.
isEmbeddedLaunch| `boolean`| This will be true if the currently running update is the one embedded in the build, and not one downloaded from the updates server.
isEmergencyLaunch| `boolean`| `expo-updates` does its very best to always launch monotonically newer versions of your app so you don't need to worry about backwards compatibility when you put out an update. In very rare cases, it's possible that `expo-updates` may need to fall back to the update that's embedded in the app binary, even after newer updates have been downloaded and run (an "emergency launch"). This boolean will be `true` if the app is launching under this fallback mechanism and `false` otherwise. If you are concerned about backwards compatibility of future updates to your app, you can use this constant to provide special behavior for this rare case.
launchDuration(optional)| `number`| Number of milliseconds it took to launch.
manifest(optional)| `[Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype)<Manifest>`| If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is the [manifest](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates/#updatesmanifest) object for the update that's currently running. In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this object is empty.
runtimeVersion(optional)| `string`| The runtime version of the current build.
updateId(optional)| `string`| The UUID that uniquely identifies the currently running update if `expo-updates` is enabled. The UUID is represented in its canonical string form and will always use lowercase letters. In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this value is undefined.Example`"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`
