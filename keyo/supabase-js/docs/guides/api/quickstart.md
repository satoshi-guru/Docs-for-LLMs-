REST API

#

Build an API route in less than 2 minutes.

##

Create your first API route by creating a public `leaderboard` table.

* * *

This guide covers creating a REST route you can query using `cURL` or the browser by creating a database table called `leaderboard` to hold player scores. This creates a corresponding API route `/rest/v1/leaderboard` which can accept `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests.

1

### Set up a Supabase project with a 'leaderboard' table

[Create a new project](/dashboard/_) in the Supabase Dashboard.

After your project is ready, create a table in your Supabase database. You can do this with either the [Table Editor](/dashboard/project/_/editor) or the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql).

SQLDashboard


    1

    -- Create a "leaderboard" table to store

    2

    -- player names and their scores.

    3

    create table leaderboard (

    4

      id serial primary key,

    5

      player text not null,

    6

      score integer not null default 0,

    7

      created_at timestamptz default now()

    8

    );

### Enable Data API access to Anon Role

Expose the `leaderboard` table through the Data API so it can be queried over HTTP. A leaderboard is meant to be public, so anonymous clients only need read access.

For more control over which tables and functions are exposed, read the [Grant access explicitly guide](/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api#grant-access-explicitly).

SQLDashboard


    1

    -- Allow read-only access for anonymous clients

    2

    grant select on public.leaderboard to anon;

3

### Configure RLS

Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for this table and create the policies that control who can read and write rows. For a leaderboard, anyone should be able to read scores. Only authenticated users should be able to submit or update them.


    1

    -- Turn on RLS

    2

    alter table "leaderboard"

    3

    enable row level security;

    4

    5

    -- Anyone can read the leaderboard

    6

    create policy "Leaderboard is public"

    7

      on leaderboard

    8

      for select

    9

      to anon, authenticated

    10

      using (true);

    11

    12

    -- Authenticated users can submit and update scores

    13

    create policy "Authenticated users can submit scores"

    14

      on leaderboard

    15

      for insert

    16

      to authenticated

    17

      with check (true);

    18

    19

    create policy "Authenticated users can update scores"

    20

      on leaderboard

    21

      for update

    22

      to authenticated

    23

      using (true)

    24

      with check (true);

4

### Enable Data API access for authenticated and service roles

With RLS setup, grant write access to the `authenticated` and `service_role` roles.


    1

    -- Grant write access only after RLS and policies are in place

    2

    grant select, insert, update, delete on public.leaderboard to authenticated;

    3

    grant select, insert, update, delete on public.leaderboard to service_role;

5

### Insert some dummy data

Now add some scores to the table so the API has something to query.


    1

    insert into leaderboard (player, score)

    2

    values

    3

      ('alice', 4200),

    4

      ('bob', 3700),

    5

      ('carol', 5100),

    6

      ('dave', 2900);

6

### Fetch the data

You can find your API URL and Keys in the [**Settings > API Settings**](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) section of the Dashboard. Query the `leaderboard` table by appending `/rest/v1/leaderboard` to the API URL.

Copy this block of code, substitute `<PROJECT_REF>` and `<PUBLISHABLE_KEY>`, then run it from a terminal.


    1

    curl 'https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/rest/v1/leaderboard?select=*&order=score.desc' \

    2

    -H "apikey: <PUBLISHABLE_KEY>"

## Bonus#

There are several options for accessing your data:

### Browser#

You can query the route in your browser, by appending the `publishable` key as a query parameter:

`https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/rest/v1/leaderboard?apikey=<PUBLISHABLE_KEY>`

### Curl#


    1

    curl 'https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/rest/v1/leaderboard?select=*&order=score.desc' \

    2

      -H "apikey: <PUBLISHABLE_KEY>" \

### Client libraries#

We provide a number of [Client Libraries](https://github.com/supabase/supabase#client-libraries).

JavaScriptDartPythonSwift


    1

    const { data, error } = await supabase

    2

      .from('leaderboard')

    3

      .select()

    4

      .order('score', { ascending: false })
