Build a User Management App with Next.js

* * *

##### Explore drop-in UI components for your Supabase app.

UI components built on shadcn/ui that connect to Supabase via a single command.

[Explore Components](https://supabase.com/ui)

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic user management app. The app authenticates and identifies the user, stores their profile information in the database, and allows the user to log in, update their profile details, and upload a profile photo. The app uses:

  * [Supabase Database](/docs/guides/database) \- a Postgres database for storing your user data and [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) so data is protected and users can only access their own information.
  * [Supabase Auth](/docs/guides/auth) \- allow users to sign up and log in.
  * [Supabase Storage](/docs/guides/storage) \- allow users to upload a profile photo.


If you get stuck while working through this guide, you can find the [full example on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/user-management/nextjs-user-management).

## Project setup#

Before you start building you need to set up the Database and API. You can do this by starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

### Create a project#

  1. [Create a new project](/dashboard) in the Supabase Dashboard.
  2. Enter your project details.
  3. Wait for the new database to launch.


### Set up the database schema#

Now set up the database schema. You can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can copy/paste the SQL from below and run it.

DashboardSQL

  1. Go to the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql) page in the Dashboard.
  2. Click **User Management Starter** under the **Community > Quickstarts** tab.
  3. Click **Run**.


You can pull the database schema down to your local project by running the `db pull` command. Read the [local development docs](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project) for detailed instructions.


    1

    supabase link --project-ref <project-id>

    2

    # You can get <project-id> from your project's dashboard URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-id>

    3

    supabase db pull

### Get API details#

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key from [the project **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks&framework=nextjs).

[Read the API keys docs](/docs/guides/getting-started/api-keys) for a full explanation of all key types and their uses.

##### Changes to API keys

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can [read the full announcement on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260).

The older `anon` and `service_role` keys will work until the end of 2026 but **we strongly encourage switching to and using** the new publishable (`sb_publishable_xxx`) and secret (`sb_secret_xxx`) keys now.

In most cases, you can get keys from [the Project's **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks&framework=nextjs), but if you want a specific key, you can find them in the [**Settings > API Keys**](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/) section of the Dashboard.

  * **For legacy keys** , copy the `anon` key for client-side operations and the `service_role` key for server-side operations from the **Legacy API Keys** tab.
  * **For new keys** , open the **API Keys** tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys** , and copy the value from the **Publishable key** section.


## Building the app#

Start building the Next.js app from scratch.

### Initialize a Next.js app#

Use [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to initialize an app called `supabase-nextjs`:


    1

    npx create-next-app@latest --ts --use-npm supabase-nextjs

    2

    cd supabase-nextjs

Install [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js):


    1

    npm install @supabase/supabase-js

Save the environment variables in a `.env.local` file at the root of the project, and paste the API URL and the key that you copied earlier.

The application exposes these variables in the browser, and that's fine as Supabase enables [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) by default on all tables.


    1

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL

    2

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

### App styling (optional)#

An optional step is to update the CSS file `app/globals.css` to make the app look better. You can find the full contents of this file [in the example repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/nextjs-user-management/app/globals.css).

### Supabase Server-Side Auth package#

Next.js is a versatile framework offering pre-rendering at build time (SSG), server-side rendering at request time (SSR), API routes, and proxy edge-functions.

To better integrate with the framework, we've created the `@supabase/ssr` package for Server-Side Auth. It has all the functionalities to quickly configure your Supabase project to use cookies for storing user sessions. Read the [Next.js Server-Side Auth guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client?queryGroups=package-manager&package-manager=npm&queryGroups=framework&framework=nextjs) for more information.

Install the package for Next.js.


    1

    npm install @supabase/ssr

### Supabase utilities#

There are two different types of clients in Supabase:

  1. **Client Component client** \- To access Supabase from Client Components, which run in the browser.
  2. **Server Component client** \- To access Supabase from Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers, which run only on the server.


We recommend creating the following utilities files for creating clients, and organize them within `lib/supabase` at the root of the project.

Create a `client.ts` and a `server.ts` with the following code for client-side Supabase and server-side Supabase, respectively.

lib/supabase/client.tslib/supabase/server.ts


    1

    import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

    2

    3

    export function createClient() {

    4

      // Create a supabase client on the browser with project's credentials

    5

      return createBrowserClient(

    6

        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,

    7

        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!

    8

      )

    9

    }

### Next.js proxy#

Since Server Components can't write cookies, you need [Proxy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/proxy) to refresh expired Auth tokens and store them.

You accomplish this by:

  * Refreshing the Auth token with the call to `supabase.auth.getClaims`.
  * Passing the refreshed Auth token to Server Components through `request.cookies.set`, so they don't attempt to refresh the same token themselves.
  * Passing the refreshed Auth token to the browser, so it replaces the old token. This is done with `response.cookies.set`.


You could also add a matcher, so that the Proxy only runs on routes that access Supabase. For more information, read [the Next.js matcher documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy#matcher).

Be careful when protecting pages. The server gets the user session from the cookies, which anyone can spoof.

The Supabase Auth SDK contains three different functions for authenticating user access to applications:

### Summary of the methods#

  * Use [`getClaims`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getclaims) to protect pages and user data. It reads the access token from storage and verifies it. Locally via the [WebCrypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and a cached JWKS endpoint when the project uses asymmetric signing keys (the default for new projects), or by calling `getUser` solely to validate when symmetric keys are in use. The returned claims always come from decoding the JWT, not from a user lookup.
  * [`getUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser) makes a network call to the project's Auth instance to get the user record, which includes the most up-to-date information about the user at the cost of a network call.
  * [`getSession`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getsession) when you need the raw session (the access token, refresh token, and expiry). For example to forward the access token to another service. The session is loaded directly from local storage and isn't re-validated against the Auth server, so the embedded user object shouldn't be trusted on its own when storage is shared with the client (cookies, request headers). To verify identity, validate the access token with `getClaims`, or call `getUser` for a fresh, server-confirmed user record.


**In summary** : use `getClaims` to verify identity (typically for protecting pages and data), `getUser` when you need an up-to-date user record from the Auth server, and `getSession` when you need the access or refresh token directly, but don't rely on the user object it returns for authorization decisions.

Create a `proxy.ts` file at the project root and another one within the `lib/supabase` folder. The `lib/supabase` file contains the logic for updating the session. The `proxy.ts` file uses this, which is a Next.js convention.

proxy.tslib/supabase/proxy.ts


    1

    import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'

    2

    import { updateSession } from '@/lib/supabase/proxy'

    3

    4

    export async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {

    5

      // update user's auth session

    6

      return await updateSession(request)

    7

    }

    8

    9

    export const config = {

    10

      matcher: [

    11

        /*

    12

         * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:

    13

         * - _next/static (static files)

    14

         * - _next/image (image optimization files)

    15

         * - favicon.ico (favicon file)

    16

         * Feel free to modify this pattern to include more paths.

    17

         */

    18

        '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',

    19

      ],

    20

    }

### Set up a login page#

#### Login and signup form#

To add login/signup page for your application, create a new folder named `login`, containing a `page.tsx` file with the following code for a login/signup form:

app/login/page.tsx


    1

    import { login, signup } from './actions'

    2

    3

    export default function LoginPage() {

    4

      return (

    5

        <form>

    6

          <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>

    7

          <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />

    8

          <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>

    9

          <input id="password" name="password" type="password" required />

    10

          <button formAction={login}>Log in</button>

    11

          <button formAction={signup}>Sign up</button>

    12

        </form>

    13

      )

    14

    }

[View source](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/cc778cedbe02c32f70a8a6c22e02e66de1df1f7a/examples/user-management/nextjs-user-management/app/login/page.tsx)

Create the login/signup actions to hook up the form to the function which does the following:

  * Retrieve the user's information.
  * Send that information to Supabase as a signup request, which in turns sends a confirmation email. It uses [Magic Links](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-passwordless#with-magic-link), so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.
  * Handle any error that arises.


Create the `action.ts` file in the `app/login` folder, which contains the login and signup functions and the `error/page.tsx` file, which displays an error message if the login or signup fails.

app/login/actions.tsapp/error/page.tsx


    1

    'use server'

    2

    3

    import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

    4

    import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

    5

    6

    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

    7

    8

    export async function login(formData: FormData) {

    9

      const supabase = await createClient()

    10

    11

      // type-casting here for convenience

    12

      // in practice, you should validate your inputs

    13

      const data = {

    14

        email: formData.get('email') as string,

    15

        password: formData.get('password') as string,

    16

      }

    17

    18

      const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(data)

    19

    20

      if (error) {

    21

        redirect('/error')

    22

      }

    23

    24

      revalidatePath('/', 'layout')

    25

      redirect('/account')

    26

    }

    27

    28

    export async function signup(formData: FormData) {

    29

      const supabase = await createClient()

    30

    31

      // type-casting here for convenience

    32

      // in practice, you should validate your inputs

    33

      const data = {

    34

        email: formData.get('email') as string,

    35

        password: formData.get('password') as string,

    36

      }

    37

    38

      const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp(data)

    39

    40

      if (error) {

    41

        redirect('/error')

    42

      }

    43

    44

      revalidatePath('/', 'layout')

    45

      redirect('/account')

    46

    }

The `cookies` method is called before any calls to Supabase, which takes fetch calls out of Next.js's caching. This is important for authenticated data fetches, to ensure that users get access only to their own data.

Read the Next.js docs to learn more about [opting out of data caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#opting-out-of-data-caching).

#### Email template#

Before proceeding, change the email template to support a server-side authentication flow that sends a token hash:

  * Go to the [Auth templates](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) page in your dashboard.
  * Select the **Confirm signup** template.
  * Change `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` to `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email`.


##### Did you know?

You can customize other emails sent out to new users, including the email's looks, content, and query parameters from [the **Authentication > Email**](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) section of the Dashboard.

#### Confirmation endpoint#

As you are working in a server-side rendering (SSR) environment, you need to create a server endpoint responsible for exchanging the `token_hash` for a session.

The code performs the following steps:

  * Retrieves the code sent back from the Supabase Auth server using the `token_hash` query parameter.
  * Exchanges this code for a session, which you store in your chosen storage mechanism (in this case, cookies).
  * Finally, redirects the user to the `account` page.


###### app/auth/confirm/route.ts


    1

    import { type EmailOtpType } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

    2

    import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

    export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {

    7

      const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)

    8

      const token_hash = searchParams.get('token_hash')

    9

      const type = searchParams.get('type') as EmailOtpType | null

    10

      const next = '/account'

    11

    12

      // Create redirect link without the secret token

    13

      const redirectTo = request.nextUrl.clone()

    14

      redirectTo.pathname = next

    15

      redirectTo.searchParams.delete('token_hash')

    16

      redirectTo.searchParams.delete('type')

    17

### Account page#

After a user signs in, they need a way to edit their profile details and manage their accounts.

Create a new component for that called `AccountForm` within the `app/account` folder.

Create an account page for the `AccountForm` component you just created

###### app/account/page.tsx


    1

    import AccountForm from './account-form'

    2

    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

    3

    4

    export default async function Account() {

    5

      const supabase = await createClient()

    6

    7

      const { data: claimsData } = await supabase.auth.getClaims()

    8

    9

      return <AccountForm claims={claimsData?.claims ?? null} />

    10

    }

### Sign out#

Create a route handler to handle the sign out from the server side, making sure to check if the user is logged in first.

###### app/auth/signout/route.ts


    1

    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

    2

    import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

    3

    import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

    4

    5

    export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {

    6

      const supabase = await createClient()

    7

    8

      // Check if a user's logged in

    9

      const { data: claimsData } = await supabase.auth.getClaims()

    10

    11

      if (claimsData?.claims) {

    12

        await supabase.auth.signOut()

    13

      }

    14

    15

      revalidatePath('/', 'layout')

    16

      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url), {

    17

        status: 302,

    18

      })

    19

    }

## Profile photos#

Next, add a way for users to upload a profile photo. Supabase configures every project with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

### Create an upload widget#

Start by creating a new component:

###### app/account/avatar.tsx


    1

    'use client'

    2

    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

    3

    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'

    import Image from 'next/image'

    5

    6

    export default function Avatar({

    7

      uid,

    8

      url,

    9

      size,

    10

      onUpload,

    11

    }: {

    12

      uid: string | null

    13

      url: string | null

    14

      size: number

    15

      onUpload: (url: string) => void

    16

    }) {

    17

      const supabase = createClient()

    18

      const [avatarUrl, setAvatarUrl] = useState<string | null>(url)

    19

      const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false)

    20

    21

      useEffect(() => {
