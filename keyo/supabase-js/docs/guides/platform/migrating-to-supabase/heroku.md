Migrate from Heroku to Supabase

##

Migrate your Heroku Postgres database to Supabase.

* * *

Supabase is one of the best [free alternatives to Heroku Postgres](/alternatives/supabase-vs-heroku-postgres). This guide shows how to migrate your Heroku Postgres database to Supabase. This migration requires the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) CLI tools, which are installed automatically as part of the complete Postgres installation package.

Alternatively, use the [Heroku to Supabase migration tool](https://migrate.supabase.com/) to migrate in just a few clicks.

## Quick demo#

## Retrieve your Heroku database credentials #

  1. Log in to your [Heroku account](https://heroku.com) and select the project you want to migrate.
  2. Click **Resources** in the menu and select your **Heroku Postgres** database.
  3. Click **Settings** in the menu.
  4. Click **View Credentials** and save the following information:
     * Host (`$HEROKU_HOST`)
     * Database (`$HEROKU_DATABASE`)
     * User (`$HEROKU_USER`)
     * Password (`$HEROKU_PASSWORD`)


## Retrieve your Supabase connection string #

  1. If you're new to Supabase, [create a project](/dashboard).
  2. Get your project's Session pooler connection string from your project dashboard by clicking [Connect](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&method=session).
  3. Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] in the connection string with your database password. You can reset your database password on the [Database Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/database/settings) if you do not have it.


## Export your Heroku database to a file #

Use `pg_dump` with your Heroku credentials to export your Heroku database to a file (e.g., `heroku_dump.sql`).


    1

    pg_dump --clean --if-exists --quote-all-identifiers \

    2

     -h $HEROKU_HOST -U $HEROKU_USER -d $HEROKU_DATABASE \

    3

     --no-owner --no-privileges > heroku_dump.sql

## Import the database to your Supabase project #

Use `psql` to import the Heroku database file to your Supabase project.


    1

    psql -d "$YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING" -f heroku_dump.sql

## Additional options#

  * To only migrate a single database schema, add the `--schema=PATTERN` parameter to your `pg_dump` command.
  * To exclude a schema: `--exclude-schema=PATTERN`.
  * To only migrate a single table: `--table=PATTERN`.
  * To exclude a table: `--exclude-table=PATTERN`.


Run `pg_dump --help` for a full list of options.

  * If you're planning to migrate a database larger than 6 GB, we recommend [upgrading to at least a Large compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons). This will ensure you have the necessary resources to handle the migration efficiently.

  * We strongly advise you to pre-provision the disk space you will need for your migration. On paid projects, you can do this by navigating to the [Compute and Disk Settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk) page. For more information on disk scaling and disk limits, check out our [disk settings](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk) documentation.
