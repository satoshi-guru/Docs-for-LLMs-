Self-Hosting

#

Self-Hosting

##

Install and run your own Supabase on your computer, server, or cloud infrastructure.

* * *

## Get started#

The fastest and recommended way to self-host Supabase is to use Docker.

## Community-driven projects#

There are several other options to deploy Supabase. If you're interested in helping these projects, visit our [Community](/contribute) page.

## About self-hosting#

Self-hosting is a good fit if you need full control over your data, have compliance requirements that prevent you from using managed services, or want to run Supabase in an isolated environment.

### How self-hosted Supabase differs#

Self-hosted Supabase is different from:

  * **Supabase CLI** (local development), which is intended for development and testing only.
  * **Managed Supabase** platform, which is fully hosted and operated by Supabase.


Self-hosted Supabase mimics a single project. Studio doesn't support multiple organizations or projects. Platform-only [features](/features) such as branching, advanced metrics beyond logs, managed backups and PITR, analytics and vector buckets, ETL, and the platform management API are **unavailable** in self-hosted configuration. Most settings are configured through [environment variables](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/.env.example).

### Your responsibilities when self-hosting#

When you self-host, **you are responsible for** :

  * Server provisioning and maintenance
  * Security hardening and keeping OS and services updated
  * Service configuration and management
  * Postgres database maintenance
  * High availability and scalability
  * Backups and disaster recovery
  * Monitoring and uptime


### Telemetry#

Self-hosted Supabase (run via Docker Compose) **does not phone home or collect any telemetry**.

The **Supabase CLI** is a [separate tool](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) and collects usage telemetry to help improve the developer experience. See [CLI telemetry](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started#telemetry) for opt-out methods.
