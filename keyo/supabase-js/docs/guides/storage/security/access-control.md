Storage Access Control

* * *

Supabase Storage is designed to work perfectly with Postgres [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) (RLS).

You can use RLS to create [Security Access Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) that are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to restrict access based on your business needs.

## Access policies#

By default Storage does not allow any uploads to buckets without RLS policies. You selectively allow certain operations by creating RLS policies on the `storage.objects` table.

You can find the documentation for the storage schema [here](/docs/guides/storage/schema/design) , and to simplify the process of crafting your policies, you can utilize these [helper functions](/docs/guides/storage/schema/helper-functions) .

If you need different `SELECT` policies for different Storage actions, such as listing objects versus reading authenticated objects, use the operation-aware helpers `storage.allow_only_operation()` and `storage.allow_any_operation()` documented in [Storage Helper Functions](/docs/guides/storage/schema/helper-functions).

The RLS policies required for different operations are documented [here](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket)

For example, the only RLS policy required for [uploading](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload) objects is to grant the `INSERT` permission to the `storage.objects` table.

To allow overwriting files using the `upsert` functionality you will need to additionally grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE` permissions.

## Policy examples#

An easy way to get started would be to create RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations and restrict the policies to meet your security requirements. For example, one can start with the following `INSERT` policy:


    1

    create policy "policy_name"

    2

    ON storage.objects

    3

    for insert with check (

    4

      true

    5

    );

and modify it to only allow authenticated users to upload assets to a specific bucket by changing it to:


    1

    create policy "policy_name"

    2

    on storage.objects for insert to authenticated with check (

    3

        -- restrict bucket

    4

        bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id'

    5

    );

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called `private` inside `my_bucket_id`:


    1

    create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"

    2

    on storage.objects

    3

    for insert

    4

    to authenticated

    5

    with check (

    6

      bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and

    7

      (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'private'

    8

    );

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called with their `users.id` inside `my_bucket_id`:


    1

    create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"

    2

    on storage.objects

    3

    for insert

    4

    to authenticated

    5

    with check (

    6

      bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and

    7

      (storage.foldername(name))[1] = (select auth.jwt()->>'sub')

    8

    );

Allow a user to access a file that was previously uploaded by the same user:


    1

    create policy "Individual user Access"

    2

    on storage.objects for select

    3

    to authenticated

    4

    using ( (select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = owner_id );

## Bypassing access controls#

If you exclusively use Storage from trusted clients, such as your own servers, and need to bypass the RLS policies, you can use the `service key` in the `Authorization` header. Service keys entirely bypass RLS policies, granting you unrestricted access to all Storage APIs.

Remember you should not share the service key publicly.
