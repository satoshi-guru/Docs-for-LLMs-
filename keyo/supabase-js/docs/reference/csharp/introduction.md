# C#Client Library

C# Reference v1.0

# C# Client Library

supabase[View on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp)

This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's C# library, [supabase](https://www.nuget.org/packages/supabase). You can use `Supabase` to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

The C# client library is created and maintained by the Supabase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and — as with all the libraries — feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

Huge thanks to official maintainer, [Joseph Schultz](https://github.com/acupofjose). As well as [Will Iverson](https://github.com/wiverson), [Ben Randall](https://github.com/veleek), and [Rhuan Barros](https://github.com/rhuanbarros) for their help.

## Installing

### Install from NuGet#

You can install Supabase package from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/supabase/)

Terminal


    1

    dotnet add package supabase

### Enable Data API access#

supabase-csharp uses the Data API to query and mutate your Postgres data. You first need to grant Data API roles permissions to access your tables and functions.

In the [**Integrations > Data API**](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/data_api/settings) section of the Dashboard, expose the specific tables and functions you want to access. To automatically grant access for new tables and functions in `public`, enable **Default privileges for new entities**.

Alternatively, use SQL to grant the required permissions:


    1

    -- Before granting access to client roles, make sure RLS is enabled

    2

    -- and create the policies required for each role's allowed operations.

    3

    alter table public.your_table enable row level security;

    4

    -- create policy ... on public.your_table ...;

    5

    6

    -- Grant least-privilege access to tables after RLS and policies are in place

    7

    grant select on public.your_table to anon;

    8

    grant select, insert, update, delete on public.your_table to authenticated;

    9

    grant all on public.your_table to service_role;

    10

    11

    -- Grant execute on functions after verifying any table access they rely on

    12

    grant execute on function public.your_function to authenticated, service_role;

* * *

## Initializing

Initializing a new client is pretty straightforward. Find your project url and public key from the admin panel and pass it into your client initialization function.

`Supabase` is heavily dependent on Models deriving from `BaseModel`. To interact with the API, one must have the associated model (see example) specified.

Leverage `Table`, `PrimaryKey`, and `Column` attributes to specify names of classes/properties that are different from their C# Versions.

StandardDependency Injection (Maui-like)With Models Example


    1

    var url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_URL");

    2

    var key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_KEY");

    3

    4

    var options = new Supabase.SupabaseOptions

    5

    {

    6

        AutoConnectRealtime = true

    7

    };

    8

    9

    var supabase = new Supabase.Client(url, key, options);

    10

    await supabase.InitializeAsync();

* * *

## Fetch data

Performs vertical filtering with SELECT.

  * **LINQ expressions do not currently support parsing embedded resource columns. For these cases,`string` will need to be used.**
  * **When using string Column Names to select, they must match names in database, not names specified on model properties.**
  * Additional information on modeling + querying Joins and Inner Joins can be found [in the `postgrest-csharp README`](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-csharp/blob/master/README.md#foreign-keys-join-tables-and-relationships)
  * By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
  * `From()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/csharp/using-modifiers)
  * `From()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/csharp/using-filters)
  * If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

    }

    16

    17

    // A result can be fetched like so.

    18

    var result = await supabase.From<City>().Get();

    19

    var cities = result.Models

* * *

## Insert data

Performs an INSERT into the table.

Create a recordBulk createFetch inserted record


    1

    [Table("cities")]

    2

    class City : BaseModel

    3

    {

    4

        [PrimaryKey("id", false)]

    5

        public int Id { get; set; }

    10

        [Column("country_id")]

    11

        public int CountryId { get; set; }

    12

    }

    13

    14

    var model = new City

    15

    {

    16

      Name = "The Shire",

    17

      CountryId = 554

    18

    };

    19

    20

    await supabase.From<City>().Insert(model);

* * *

## Update data

Performs an UPDATE on the table.

  * `Update()` is typically called using a model as an argument or from a hydrated model.


Update your data using FilterUpdate your data


    1

    var update = await supabase

    2

      .From<City>()

    3

      .Where(x => x.Name == "Auckland")

    4

      .Set(x => x.Name, "Middle Earth")

    5

      .Update();

* * *

## Upsert data

Performs an UPSERT into the table.

  * Primary keys should be included in the data payload in order for an update to work correctly.
  * Primary keys must be natural, not surrogate. There are however, [workarounds](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1118) for surrogate primary keys.


Upsert your dataUpserting into tables with constraintsReturn the exact number of rows


    1

    var model = new City

    2

    {

    3

      Id = 554,

    4

      Name = "Middle Earth"

    5

    };

    6

    7

    await supabase.From<City>().Upsert(model);

* * *

## Delete data

Performs a DELETE on the table.

  * `Delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/csharp/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.


Delete records


    1

    await supabase

    2

      .From<City>()

    3

      .Where(x => x.Id == 342)

    4

      .Delete();

* * *

## Call a Postgres function

You can call functions as a "Remote Procedure Call".

That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere. It's especially useful when the logic rarely changes - like password resets and updates.

Call a database functionWith Parameters


    1

    await supabase.Rpc("hello_world", null);

Notes

* * *

## Using filters

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `Select()`, `Update()`, and `Delete()` queries.

**Note: LINQ expressions do not currently support parsing embedded resource columns. For these cases,`string` will need to be used.**

    2

    {

    3

        Id = 224,

    4

        Name = "Atlanta"

    5

    };

    6

    7

    var model = supabase.From<City>().Match(city).Single();

* * *

## Don't match the filter

Finds all rows which doesn't satisfy the filter.

With `Select()`


    1

    var result = await supabase.From<Country>()

* * *

## Using modifiers

Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., setting a limit or offset).

* * *

## Order the results

Orders the result with the specified column.

With `Select()`With embedded resourcesOrder parent table by a referenced table


    1

    var result = await supabase.From<City>()

    2

    3

      .Order(x => x.Id, Ordering.Descending)

    4

      .Get();

* * *

## Limit the number of rows returned

Limits the result with the specified count.

With `Select()`With embedded resources


    1

    var result = await supabase.From<City>()

    2

      .Select(x => new object[] { x.Name, x.CountryId })

    3

      .Limit(10)

    4

      .Get();

* * *

## Limit the query to a range

Limits the result to rows within the specified range, inclusive.

With `Select()`


    1

    var result = await supabase.From<City>()

    2

      .Select("name, country_id")

    3

      .Range(0, 3)

    4

      .Get();

* * *

## Retrieve one row of data

Retrieves only one row from the result. Result must be one row (e.g. using limit), otherwise this will result in an error.

With `Select()`


    1

    var result = await supabase.From<City>()

    2

      .Select(x => new object[] { x.Name, x.CountryId })

    3

      .Single();

* * *

## Create a new user

Creates a new user.

  * By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
  * **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
    * If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
    * If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
  * When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
  * If SignUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    * When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    * When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.


Sign up.


    1

    var session = await supabase.Auth.SignUp(email, password);

* * *

## Listen to auth events

Receive a notification every time an auth event happens.

  * Types of auth events: `AuthState.SignedIn`, `AuthState.SignedOut`, `AuthState.UserUpdated`, `AuthState.PasswordRecovery`, `AuthState.TokenRefreshed`


Listen to auth changes


    1

    supabase.Auth.AddStateChangedListener((sender, changed) =>

    2

    {

    3

        switch (changed)

    4

        {

    5

            case AuthState.SignedIn:

    6

                break;

    7

            case AuthState.SignedOut:

    8

                break;

    9

            case AuthState.UserUpdated:

    10

                break;

    11

            case AuthState.PasswordRecovery:

    12

                break;

    13

            case AuthState.TokenRefreshed:

    14

                break;

    15

        }

    16

    });

* * *

## Sign in a user

Log in an existing user using email or phone number with password.

  * Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.


Sign in with email and passwordSign in with phone and password


    1

    var session = await supabase.Auth.SignIn(email, password);

* * *

## Sign in a user through OTP

  * Requires either an email or phone number.
  * This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
  * If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
  * If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
  * The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls). You can modify the `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect urls in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/settings).


Send Magic Link.Sign in with SMS OTP.


    1

    var options = new SignInOptions { RedirectTo = "http://myredirect.example" };

    2

    var didSendMagicLink = await supabase.Auth.SendMagicLink("joseph@supabase.io", options);

Notes

* * *

## Sign in a user through OAuth

Signs the user in using third party OAuth providers.

  * This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
  * Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).


Sign in using a third-party providerWith scopes


    1

    var signInUrl = supabase.Auth.SignIn(Provider.Github);

* * *

## Sign out a user

Signs out the current user, if there is a logged in user.

  * In order to use the `SignOut()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.


Sign out


    1

    await supabase.Auth.SignOut();

* * *

## Verify and log in through OTP

  * The `VerifyOtp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change`.
  * The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `VerifyOtp` to sign up / sign-in a user.


Verify Sms One-Time Password (OTP)


    1

    var session = await supabase.Auth.VerifyOTP("+13334445555", TOKEN, MobileOtpType.SMS);

* * *

## Update a user

Updates user data, if there is a logged in user.

  * In order to use the `UpdateUser()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
  * By Default, email updates sends a confirmation link to both the user's current and new email. To only send a confirmation link to the user's new email, disable **Secure email change** in your project's [email auth provider settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/settings).

## Subscribe to channel

Subscribe to realtime changes in your database.

  * Realtime is disabled by default for new Projects for better database performance and security. You can turn it on by [managing replication](/docs/guides/api#managing-realtime).
  * If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes, you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

## Unsubscribe from a channel

Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.

  * Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
